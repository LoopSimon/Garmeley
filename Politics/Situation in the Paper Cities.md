The Landscape of the Paper Cities and Battvia, in the fall of 922PA

  
  

The Paper Cities, specifically the three cities of Albesan, Ligoggia and Butera are perhaps the most interesting political entity on the Continent in that they are no centralized government or semi autonomous realm, but rather a Union of rich cities and its ruling elite, primarily the dominant burghers.

  
  

Almost 150 years ago, Prince Guido II “the Lame” of Battvia lost the lands of the Buteran Gulf and control over the three Cities in what is now known as the Battvian Civil war of 792 PA.

Battvia had long been enjoying the influx of trade and travel into the Gulf from all over the Continent owed due to the discoveries of the Great Expedition into Rakh an the Monopoly of all such ventures held by the Buterian Guild and Guido's Grandfather, Prince Anselmo I, had signed the so called “Great Privilege” which granted the Cities of Battiva great autonomy and influence on national and local politics in exchange for increased taxation in the wake of the Great Expedition.

When Guido refused to obey the wishes of the Cities as far as his marriage with the northern Meadrath was concerned, a right that was granted to the Grand Mayoral Council within the Great Privilege, and opted to marry a local noble instead the seeds for revolt were sown and soon after the Western Cities rose up in arms.

The War lasted for 8 years and at the dawn of the 9th century, the royalist party relented and signed for Peace with the now nominally liberated Paper Cities, a name coined due to the enormous printing industry in Albesan.

  
  

Over 100 years later, the city of Vorella attempted to secede from the Battvian Throne as well and join ranks with the rich cities of the Gulf, however as war broke out again Queen Gisella V of Meadrath joined forces with Prince Canto I of Battvia in what many theorize to be an attempt to stop the spread of anti-monarchist thought in Meadrath's southern neighbour.

And so it was that for 9 long years, the soldiers and mercenaries of the Paper Cities fought against the armies of the Duchy of Battvia and reinforcements from Meadrath,a war that saw the first use of gunpowder as gnomish mortars rained terror on the battlefields and flintlock rifles were used by especially rich or lucky mercenaries.

The War ended in 919PA with the victory of Battvia and the Subjugation of Vorella but saw Battvia's Economy almost ruined and the country enter severe debt to local and foreign moneylanders.

  
  
  

Albesan, the largest and richest of the three Paper Cities, has attempted to ease relations with Ott and Battvia and entered into treaties with the dwarves of Ogul-Vosko and the Petty Kingdom of Niedmer across the Mountains.

Grand-Mayor Livius Grimo, the head of the Printers Guild, rules Albesan and has made it into one of the largest and richest cities in the entire world, law and order are set in place and people of almost all races and religions are welcome here.

  
  
  

In Butera, the Buteran Excavators Guild controls most aspects of life and owed to its location and naval supremacy the city had been almost entirely unharmed during the recent Wars; New expeditions into Rakh and attempts to establish routes into far Cyraclion for the same purpose are launched from Buteras Ports every week and hopeful adventurers may find themselves disappointed that international interests and powerful Institutions have taken control of what once was a place of romantic ideals.

  
  

Lastly Ligoggia, can even by the best people only be described as a city of scoundrels: the local authorities have long been killed, bought out or replaced by shady figures, power brokers and crimelords.

Chief among them, the figure only known as ”The Baker” control the flow of Drugs across the entire Gulf and can be seen as the closest to a Mayor of the City, Ligoggia attracts every type of person in the world , few laws and rules are enforced here and few ask for your past, naive do-gooders, and rogues down on their luck, criminals and fortune-seekers alike all find their ways to the City of Crime.
