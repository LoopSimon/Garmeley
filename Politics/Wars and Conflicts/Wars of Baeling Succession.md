[[Baeling]] [[Juelfluk]]

A series of armed conflicts between the Remnants of the Baeling Empire of Trykkerog, the Kingdom of Juelfluk and Baeling.

With the Fall of the Baeling Empire in 590PA, the House of Juelfluk under Rossgi I had declared its hegemony over the lands and peoples of the Malksbay soon after in 617PA.
For a long time the legendary House of Baeling was thought extinct until the emergence of Sivdil the Tall, the leader of the Runeblade Mercenary Company that laid claim to the Baeling name in 684PA.

After unifying the lands of Sallesand and Alsebyn under his newly declared Baeling Kingdom, Sivdil announced his claim to the former lands of the fallen Baeling Empire, including the entirety of Trykkerog which led to a series of Wars between his new realm and the other powers in the region, first and foremost the Kings and Queens of Juelfluk.

The 9th War of Baeling Succession is the most recent entry in this conflict, having broken out in 911PA and only ended in 916PA it was fought in a period of Baeling decline over the city of Troese across Melmers Bay.
Lacking supports of its eastern lords due it internal struggle, King Varald I of Baeling managed to still defend the Siege of Troese against the forces of Queen Madeley IV of Juelfluk.
