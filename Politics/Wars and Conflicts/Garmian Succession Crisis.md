**Potential Spoilers**

Duchess Agnes died during the Midsummer Festival of 922 PA as a result of Jonek Two-Tongues Prison break, the infamous Sorcerer was later hunted down and brought to justice by brave adventurers.
The Duchess passed on at the age of 26 unmarried and without any offspring, leaving behind a realm deeply divided by religious and economic policies and realities.

Soon after her death, Coster of Melmbirth declares the Green Banner League and his claim to the Riverthrone of Redflow, in reference to ancient custom.
The Green Banner is a primarily religious group, assembled to support the interests of the majority Gethric northern lands of the Duchy, powerful local supporters include Lord Kylian the Castellan of Redflow Keep, Countess Nadya of Dimglade and the Lord-Mayor Gustav of Jorrenstead.

While their members cannot hope to compete with the riches of the south, and the northern lands are less densely populated, the foreign support for the Green Banner League is large.
Primarily aligned with the Urien Lords of Eldmar and Urbridge, the most influential ally of Coster is the powerful Kingdom of Vihr across the Trollback Mountains.
Even though the conversion of the rich Garmeley to Gethricism is a main motivation, any supporter of the Count of Melmbirth may count on large influence upon the Realm in the case of his victory, considering his vague claim and weak position.


In response Count Hynek of Forrington, nephew of the late duchess by her half-sister has assembled the so called "Garmish Alliance" in an attempt to press his claim by blood, joined by the rich and traditionally spirit-worshipping southern lords like the Counts Elric of Thulmouth and Miklas of Koltree , the Baron Roderick of Aldale as well as the Arcanist Vaelon of Patwin Tower.

The rich and traditionally spirit-worshipping South, is supported primarily by the Princedom of Hainach, as blood ties bind the nobility of Pikris to the Count of Forrington and the Trinvale Republics who enjoy old and profitable trade relations with the cities on the mouth of the Trinmo.
