*Important Battles:* 916 PA: Battle of Modim Caves

During the 2nd half of the 9th century, the ruling elite of Ogul-Vosko decided to adhere the call to war of their priesthood: The High Priest of Ogul-Makar had prophesised a great victory against the goblin city of Mitimgar, located many miles to the north within the central underlands, should zealous warriors of the Hold take up arms and march against their goblinoid foes.

What started as at first extremely successful campaign, largely due to the Mitimgari government being caught by complete surprise, quickly became a desperate war of attrition for both sides.
Within the thousands of caves surrounding the Modim Cavern, hundreds of warfronts were opened and conflicts erupted, resulting in an enormous resource drain on both nations, and generations of goblins and dwarves being lost in war.

By the 920s the Crusade has not slowed down: Mitimgar had been long supplied by its large network of undercity settlements across the great lake to its north and would not simply be defeated through attrition while the Dwarves of Ogul-Vosko established mile long supply chains and over multiple decades restructured almost their entire nations economy to serve the war.

The last decisive engagement was the Battle of Modim Cave, lasting for almost 2 years and being fought in multiple smaller tunnels around the massive opening below northern Urland. 
While the troops  of Ogul-Vosko ended up claiming victory at Modim, the 2nd Army - the holds largest standing force - was almost entirely wiped out due to the ruthless tactics employed by the dwarven military high command (examples include experimental explosives being used to create new tunnels and sending in thousands of soldiers in smaller troops to explore unmapped terrain within unstable areas of the underground caves).

The effects of the war are depressing: Mitimgar, once a city so great and rich it could rival Pintrixaz, had been cut off from almost all outside communication and started to rely on questionable rituals and desperate experiments to defend its lands. Ogul-Vosko had lost almost all its influence on the overworld of Ilrakhan, its economy now fully focused on maintaining a less and less endearing prospect, the state maintaining that its cause is just but multiple generations of the hold have now been scarred by war.
