[[Grachy]] [[Ukiolla]]

The Great Eastern War is a series of conflicts between the Republic of Grachy (formerly the Kingdom of Halgrach) an the Principality of Ukiolla that has lasted for over 100 years and is still ongoing.
The last major belligerent action took place in 906PA during the so called Kulyat-Incident.
The Baron Kulyat, a barony and border Castle in Northern Grachy, had passed on and the fortifications were seized by Ukiollan paramilitary troops, likely woodland druids.
The Ukiollan Government later claimed  responsibility for the act and took Kulyat Castle which set the staging ground for larger military conflict between the two countries to reignite.
Largely employing western Mercenary Bands such as the [[Sons of Kasimir]] , Grachy managed to reconquer the Castle after  1 1/2 years of fighting in 907PA.
