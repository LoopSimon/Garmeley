<p>Signed in 876 PA after the end of the War of Horn and Fang, a conflict that lasted over 25 years and was largely fought over control of the City of Uhl and the Bay of Uhl between the major geopolitical Powers of Vihr and Meadrath.</p>

<p>The signators agree to uphold and defend the independence of the City of Uhl as a free city,
as well as to protect the trade routes through the Sallesand Strait, and along the Trinmo bend.
Furthermore both Vihr and Meadrath agreed to not interfere with the minting of Coins at Uhl and Talshol by the Bank of Uhl and lastly to adopt the Urien Gryphon as State currency.</p>
