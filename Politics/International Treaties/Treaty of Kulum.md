<p>Signed in 908PA, shortly after the founding of New Kulum in 902PA and the Reclamation of the Ruins of Kulum in 889PA, this document is concerned with the threat of the Followers of Ahrmiz, colloquially referred to as the Cult of Ahrmiz by the public or the Onyx Cult by the <a href="Kherovan Inquisition">Kherovan Inquisition</a>.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">

<h3>Treaty stipulations</h3>
<p>Essentially granting Agents of the Kherovan Inquisition special authority beyond the borders of the Kathrym, the treaty aims to destroy the remnants of the Cult that can be found in the lands of Ilrakhan.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">

<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>In essence few Inquisitors dare cite the treaty when in larger cities or confronted with powerful nobility, but it provides excellent broad justifications against local lawmen or petty landholders and even less influential feudal lords to act within their own interest.</p>
