A set of rules and restrictions regarding Magical Practice instated roughly 300 years after the [[Wermia]]n Incursions, referencing them as an example of the havoc and destruction unchecked magic can wreak upon the material Plane.
Primarily enforced by at first only Followers of [[Gethricism]] but later virtually all nations on Ilrakhan.

The Accords ban the practice, teaching or preservation of the following:

Any spell, charm or curse of the School of Necromancy.

Spells, charms or curses that influence, invade or alter another's mind.

Spells, charms or curses that create gateways through the material realm, be that to other planes of existence or the spiritual realm, including instantaneous transposition via teleportation magic.

The Creation of Absolute Fluxbridges, as understood by [[Basic Magical Theory]].

Signators of the Wermian Accords also agree to control and oversee the training and schooling of practitioners of the Arcane and Divine Disciplines of Magic, as well as to take active steps to eradicate rogue mages or other practitioners of magic outside of their control that may break or threaten to break the guidelines set by the Accords.

Signed at the Headquarters of the Order of the Silver Wheel, in the town of Morael and close to the remnants of Old Wermia, the Accords where very much dictated by the paramilitary Orders of the [[Church of Iztaw]], that at the time enjoyed never before or since seen political power.
Although the Accords also offered many monarchs and rulers foreign to Vihr justification to crack down on the political power of Mages within their own countries.

The Signators of the Accords over the years include:

The Khat of [[Kherova]]
The Patriarch of Kher and Head of [[Kethricism]]
The High-Bishop of Iztaw, Head of [[Gethricism]]
The King of [[Vihr]]
The King of [[Meadrath]]
The King of [[Baeling]]
The King of [[Juelfluk]]
The Prince of [[Battvia]]
The Highlord of [[Xer-Kol]]
The Speaker of [[Tizin-Kol]]
