The Mogyri of southern Nirydia are a race of humanoid creatures that live in the jungles of the Drizan Peninsula.
They tend to be extremely xenophobic and isolationist, mostly owed from a desire to protect their biome and the Fungi carried on their backs.
This symbiotic relationship between Mogyr and Fungi, also known as Shroom-bonding, is almost entirely exclusive to the Mogyr but has been observed in other races (there are reports of [[Qalmyr]]i Sailors undergoing bonding though the process is usually described as agonizing).
Mogyr tend to grow up to 7 or 8 ft tall, however most adult members of the race live out their days on all fours, protecting and exposing their shroom-infested backs to the skies.
The average Mogyr lives up to an age of 100 although there are reports of Mogyr Elders achieving lifespans of up to 170 years, this is largely attributed to excessive usage of their bonded mushroom which can in rare cases act as a magical artifact. 

# Shroombonding

Within hours of being born a Mogyri receives, usually by a parent or guardian, their bonded Mushroom. What type of Fungi one bonds with is determined by the circumstances of ones birth: 
Due to the fact that a shroom can only be given by one willing to sacrifice a part of their own, the shroom of a parent or caretaker tends to be passed on to their offspring.
This has resulted in important bloodlines being born and extinguished by matter of shroombonding, as well as prestige and social standing being influenced by the origin of ones bonded shroom.

Following the nature of shroom bonding as a core axis of all aspects of Mogyri life, those without a shroom are almost unilaterally rejected and shunned from society. 
The only two major ways to lose ones shroom are ritualistic punishment for the graves of crimes and magical means of ending a bond. There are known cases of children being born without someone willing to give them a shroom, sometimes outcasts for social reasons such as bastards within the higher houses of the Yl-Lhatsi society.
