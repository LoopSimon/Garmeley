Numerous and ingenious in their variance, humans are by far the most popular race in Vihr and Ilrakhi, they tend to organize in large communities and hierarchies, flocking to religion, magic and charismatic leaders who can promise salvation in this life or the next.

Humans tend to live up to 80 years naturally, although spells or the mere prolonged exposure to magic are known to extend this while many can also fall under this expectancy due to regional infrastructure and wealth. 

Humany has produced many legends and heroes, founded Faiths and forged arcane wonders, while their greatest strength is adaptability, they also tend to excel less in niche aspects of life, warfare or academia.  
Nevertheless it is precisely in this incredible diversity of thought and body that humanity has found the strength to bend most of the known world to its will.
