Small in stature, the bearded and sturdy dwarves are masterful stone and metal workers that live in deep cavern cities and mountain holds.

The greatest Dwarven Cities are built in exhausted volcanos where they believe their gods of forge and fire fought in older days, an structured as ringed vertical civilizations build around central chambers.

Unlike their surface loving cousins, the dwarves of the world are less interested in the worldly affairs of war and politics, preferring to tend their ancient halls and worship through craftsmanship. They can generally live for up to 150 years and reach a height of at most 5 ft or 150 centimetres; their eyes are adapted to darkness and can see detail and far in dim light but struggle a little to make out details at range when in the sunlight of the surface world.
