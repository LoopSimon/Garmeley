The Cousins and close relatives of Dwarves, Gnomefolk dislike the underground and prefer to live under the sun and moon of the world instead.  
As opposed to their [[Dwarf]] relatives, they can barely grow a beard and are even smaller at an average 4ft. While reaching the same lifespan of about 150 years.

Outside of the City of Ott, there are almost no larger settlements of just gnomes, who instead prefer to found families in the communities of elves and humans, often seen in Gnomish Ghettos in the larger Metropolis of the world.

It is said that while they are mostly spreading their knowledge through the commercial enterprise of Institutions like the Ott Syndicate, the Gnomish Theoretical Metaphysicists and Arcanists are the most learned Researchers in the Realm of Magical Theory, especially when it comes to applied Artificery, the study of Maintenance, Manipulation and Creation of Magical Objects and Artifacts.

This deep understanding of such a useful aspect of the weave of the world, coupled with their politically speaking humble nature, has given the Gnomes a great reputation in almost every corner of the world.
