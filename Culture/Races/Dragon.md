A list of known Dragons

***Heximar***
	known as "the Unlit" due to his black scales, descended the central Kortopi's in the late 3rd century BA. 
	After devastating the Meadi Highlands, modern day [[Meadrath]], he was supposedly slain by the Hero Gismar, 
	founder of the House of Gismar that would continue to rule the Gisvale for centuries.

***Fagnir***
	mythical Dragon of [[Trykkerog]] mentioned in the Saga of Ylva.

***Thamira***
The Antagonist in *"The Fated Journey of Khariel"*, a Kherovan tale describing the real life figure of Khariel, likely dated to the Era of Cities in the history of [[Kherova]], Thamira's Rest, the rocky lands on the south-eastern slopes of the Mistspires, are named after this Wyrm.
Attempts to reconstruct the origin of the tale have largely been hindered by the [[Kherovan Inquisition]]s lockdown of the Ruins of Alahmid, following the exploits of the Wizard Merzigal,
but there are those who believe Thamira may not have been a Dragon at all, but instead perhaps a creation of the "Great Sculptor" or even an entity from beyond our Plane of existance.
