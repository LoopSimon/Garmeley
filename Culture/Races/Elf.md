(High)Elf

The Elves of Behera live far longer lives than most mortals, with a common elf being able to see almost 250 common calendar years. Said to have been the first civilization to develop agriculture and erect great cities, the elves put an enormous value on record keeping and history, revering their ancestors as paragons and offering tribute to those who came before.

The vast majority of this species are situated alongside the coasts and bountiful rivers of the Beheran Desert having been unified under the ancient Dynasties and the Sultans of the current Age as a politically almost unified race, yet there are elven communities in the far north east and south of old Jiravid that have sought a life under a different rule, religion and philosophy.

Elves usually appear slender and tall, being easily distinguished from humans by their tall and pointy ears and giant eyes. They stop carrying children at a young age of around 30, which has historically led to various attempts of artificially growing their population through science and magic.

They display a natural affinity to certain aspects of magic, primarily the arcane but are not known to produce an abnormal amount of trueborn mages. 

  

Drow

The Drow, also known as Under-Elves of Dark-Elves, are the extremely closely related cousins of the Elves, their appearance changed from over two millenia of a live underground: Their skin is fair and pale, their eyes usually even larger than those of their surface kin and extremely sensitive to the sunlight.

The Drow are rarely seen above ground, but many serve in the Undercities of the Sultanat where the grand Mausoleums of the Surface reveal their true extent as giant resting places of worship for their fallen Paragons.

  

Half Elf

Classically described as the result of a Union between Elf and Man, dominant human features will usually quickly overtake the more discernible elven heritage.

A relatively large number of Half-Elves exists within the Elbae Sultanate, as well as within the Southern Realms of Battiva, Garmeley and the Paper Cities, although they are rarely seen in bigger numbers in Grevenna or Vihr.
