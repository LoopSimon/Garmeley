Generally smaller sized, Kobolds are bipedal, scaled reptilian humanoids that tend to weigh about 60 pounds standing at around 4ft tall. They are native to the [[Nirydia]]n Subcontinent and show variance in phenotype based on their environment: There are reports for significant differing in size, head- and tail shape based on regional origin, as well as the striking change in the tint of their scale colour.
Although they like claim kinship to [[Dragon]]s, there is no evidence outside of the mythological that would agree with the idea the two races are related.
