Also known as the "Ratfolk", a derogatory term usually used to insult them, the Shirin of Nirydia are the most numerous race on the continent, having ruled the [[Twintail Empire]] for houndreds of years.
They are rodent-like humanoids that once were native to the subterranean underlands, averaging at a height between 4 and 5 feet with extremely pronounced noses and tails often covered in varying degrees of fur. 
The Tails of the Shirin are one of their most identifying features and possess thermoregulatory qualities: the high muscular and connective tissue densities of the tail, along with ample muscle attachment sites along its plentiful caudal vertebrae, facilitate specific proprioceptive senses to help orient the shirin in a three-dimensional environment even without any vision.
