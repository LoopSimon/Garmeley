[[Ott]]
The Art of Artificery describes the three Schools of magical research related to Artifacts, Maintenance, Modulation and Creation, and nobody can deny the gnomes of Ott their superiority in this field.

While Maintenance is common enough knowledge to be found elsewhere, Modulation is a much more complex subject to tackle and Creation is a school so occult it is basically only taught and practiced to a large extent within the Twin City itself. 

A Graduate of the Ottian Schools receives a mark of trade and is offered membership in the syndicate, should they choose to leave the Twin City behind which many do, joining the court of a noble lord or setting up shop in a lucrative location to offer their service for coin.

The Syndicate as an Institution offers its members safe communication and access to research and resources, while its treaties with many cities and governments benefit its members as well.

Politically the Syndicate of Ott has long been at odds with the Buteran Excavators guild, who see the creation of artifacts as a massive threat to their business based on the excavation of rakhian resources to the same ends, as the Syndicate is a more or less official branch of the Ottian Government and thereby closely tied to the Kingdom of Meadrath however, any actual conflict between the two organisations usually occurs in backrooms, offices or in the wilderness.
