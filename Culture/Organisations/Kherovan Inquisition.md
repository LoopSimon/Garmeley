[[Kherova]] [[Kethricism]]


Founded in the Year 585PA, as a response to the findings of the Great Expedition in Rakh, 
this institution is under the direct control of the Patriarch of Kher as the head of the Kethric denomination.
The symbol of the Inquisition is the All-Seeying Eye of Truth engulfed in the Flames of Kethric.


The Inquisition bemoans the Wermian Accords as the main agreement to regulate Magic, as it is in their words “a near 400 year old document that could not fathom the cruel ingenuity to come”, and is officially tasked with enforcing Magical Law within Kher itself.

However due to the good relationship with Vihr and Grevenna that Kher keeps, as well as their economic power as the main trade route to Nirydia, Kherovan Inquisitors often operate outside of their country, and can even hold royal mandates allowing the pursuit and handling of any Fugitive, Criminal or Threat to Kher and her people.

In reality most stories around Kher Inquisitors or “Witchfinders” as they are known outside the eastern country are not nearly as negative as one would believe, while stories of them ripping away children from parents or burning citizens on a pyre exist, they are usually paired with reports of the Inquisitors genuinely helping commonfolk, detaining and hunting down aberrations or pacifying rogue and criminal casters.


The Treaty of Kulum, signed by most nations on the continent as a result of the rise and fall of Ahrmiz Saceren, commonly known as Ahrmiz the Conjurer, gave Kherovan Inquisitors international legal authority to apprehend remnants of the Cult, a practice that is often criticised by local lords and authorities as well abused by individual agents of the Inquisition that use it as an opportunity to enact secret missions and witch-hunts across the Continent.

The Seat of the Inquisition is the Capital city of Kher, at the Silent Monastery, it is organized in 9 Tribunals each with their own hierarchies, tasks and histories.
Each Tribunal serves under a High Inquisitor who all sit on the High Inquisitorial Council that heads the Organization and is itself only subject to the will of the Patriarch of Kher.
The Inquisitorial Hierarchy within the Tribunals consists of one High Inquisitor, the Inquisitors of the Tribunals itself over all Tribunals combined totalling at about 300, the Acolytes of the Tribunals that seek to ascend to the rank of Inquisitor themselves and can range between Tribunals from a mere dozen to over a hundred in number and below them the Inquisitorial Personal that totals easily over a thousand and consists of soldiers, clerks, writers, envoys and many more aides.
