[[Elbae]] [[Basic Magical Theory]]

Named after the **Great Mage Karajal of Alparaz**(304PA-581PA), this Institution represents not only the modern nexus of magical research, but also is a symbol of the historical dominance the [[Behera|Beheran]] [[Elf|Elves]] have held in the higher Sciences of Mathematics, Magic and Astronomy.

Indeed, Karajal as an Academic is one of the greatest in a line of greats, a scholar that can trace back his influences to the beginning of the Sultanate under his mentor, Kwarzimi of Corbaik who himself is known as the Father of elven spell-craft and the Leypoint Model. 

Kwarzimi rejected the established Rakhian models of Conflux-dependency as declared by Phiodales of Mizk, an author and mage in the latter days of ancient [[Rakh]].

The greatest minds, usually but not exclusively [[Elf|elven]], of the Continent gather in the Grey Tower of Alparaz, the highest spire of the School, and delve deep into the knowledge of their fore bearers.

Indeed so revered and respected is this house of learning, that it largely remains untouched by the political influence of the Sultan and has even openly voiced dissonance with decisions of the Palace in Jiravid without any official reprimand.

The School has stood in relatively close contact with the researchers at Patwin Towers in Garmeley even when the Duchy fought the Sultanate during the Wars of Aggression.

It is said that the wearers of the Star of Karajal, the mark of graduates of all disciplines, is seen by many nobles and academics as a sign of great renown that could open many a door, and is sought after with even more desire than similar status symbols by the [[Korsfall College]] or  [[The Ottian Syndicate]] .
