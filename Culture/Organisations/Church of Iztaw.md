[[Gethricism|Gethric]] Clergy of Iztaw, the Head of the Gethrist Church which has canonized almost all [[Gethric Saints]] in History.

Representing the oldest denomination of Gethricism, the Clerics and Priests of Iztaw are present in Chapels and Churches around the modern world.

What differentiates them from Clerics following [[Trinicism]] besides their actual teachings, is their organisation as the Iztaw Clergy follows a strict hierarchy of Priests, Clerics and Bishops that all report and answer to the office of the High-Bishop of Iztaw itself.

The vast funds and incredible influence on their worshippers have often led to this Institution of Faith to be seen as barely less than a Nation of its own, for many decades of history it was true that the High-Bishop was the most powerful man in [[Vihr]], not the King in Zavlech.

It is said that Agents of the Church take on forms and guises of all shapes and colours, and work from the light of the altar as much as from the shadows of an alleyway, but beyond anything else the Clergy values discretion and therefore their methods or involvement is usually left to speculations.
