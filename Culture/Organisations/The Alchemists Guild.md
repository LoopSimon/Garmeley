Also known as the "Men of Glass", this Guild was founded in the later 7th century in Trazlov.
The group claims arcane knowledge of the physical composition of the world and controls most of the potion trade on Ilrakhan.
Supposedly their founding goal had  been to turn lesser metals or other substances into gold through non magical means, however this process never succeeded in any meaningful of provable way.

They are present throughout most of the larger cities ion Ilrakhan and even have outposts in Kherova and the Elbae Sultanate acting as an entirely independent organization from the Vihri Kingdom even though their Headquarters are still at the Violet Hall in Trazlov.

An unofficial rivalry between the Guild and the [[The Ottian Syndicate]] exists, mostly on an economic level, as the two institutions occupy a similar niche as far as arcane supplies are concerned and often have to compete within local communities.
