[[Uhl]]
The largest Bank in the known world and the centre of currency regulation, is the Vrieman Bank whose Headquarters are within the walls of the Free City of Uhl.

The Currency regulated and printed in Uhl is known as the Urien Gryphon, and commonly used in its form as the Gold Gryphon, the Silver Gryphon and the Hatchling.

During the aftermath of the War of Horn and Fang, both Meadrath and Vihr agreed to uphold the currency and full autonomy of the City, in exchange for fair trade rights along the Trinmo and Uhl Toll in Urland and the Torn Sea for both.

While on paper such an agreement may have weakened the city itself, in reality it became an extremely safe and lucrative harbour for trade and its identity as the home of the largest financial institution in the world, regulating all currency north of the Sultanate saw Uhl and the Vrieman Bank grow at a rate nobody even dreamed of.

The Bank has offices in most major cities in the known world, including Jiravid although the Urien Gryphon is not common currency in the Sultanate.
