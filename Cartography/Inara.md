Inara is the largest continental area on the [[Globus]], comprising all of [[Ilrakhan]], [[Behera]] and [[Nirydia]].
According to some more modern cartographers more concerned with oceanic discovery, Inara itself is a single continent but this is not a commonly held view.
The largest mountain range on Inara are the Mistspires, and its largest river is the Trinmo.
