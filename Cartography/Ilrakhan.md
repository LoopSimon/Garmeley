Ilrakhan is one of the three major continents on the [[Inara]]n continental area, it borders Nirydia at the Mistspires in the east and Behera at the Cloudscratchers in the South.
The Name Ilrakhan, meaning literally "of Rakh" stems from the ancient  [[Rakh]]ian civilization that dominated western Ilrakhan in Antiquity.
Traditionally the large island of [[Trykkerog]] is viewed as part of Ilrakhan.
The largest mountain range on Inara are the Kortopis, and its largest river is the Trinmo.
