Malham, known as the North Star, sits more or less directly above the Worlds northern Pole along its rotational axis, due to its vicinity to it, it traces a very small circle over a rotation and will always stay roughly in the same place of the sky.
Therefore it is a reliable way for sailors to find the direction of north.

To the Orcs of the [[Qalmyr]] it is known as "the child of destiny" and associated with hope and innocence. 

Within the Cyclopi [[Starworship]], Malham is the outer God of Magic and the strongest force in their cosmology.
