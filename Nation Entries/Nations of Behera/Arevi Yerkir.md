<p>The <b>Arevi</b> are an ancient, semi-nomadic people inhabiting <b>Arevi Yerkir</b>, the foothills of the <b>Cloudscratchers</b>. Known as masterful horsemen and fierce protectors of their sacred lands, they have remained in a state of perpetual conflict with the <a href="Elbae" class="internal-link">Elbae Sultanate</a> for generations.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<h3>The Ancient Bloodline</h3>
<p>The Arevi claim an unbroken lineage from before the <b>Eruption of Al-Akka</b>. Oral tradition speaks of a <b>Sun Spirit</b> that guided them to Arevi Yerkir, teaching them to survive the harsh environment before tasking them with the eternal protection of the land. This divine mandate makes them view any foreign settlement as a desecration of holy ground.</p>

<h3>The Elven Conflict</h3>
<p>While initial contact with Elven explorers was peaceful, the subsequent attempt by Elven settlers to claim the lush western hills sparked a horrific war. After the Arevi butchered a settlement and sent back thirty blinded survivors as a warning, the Elven response was a campaign of extermination.</p>

<p>The Arevi survived by uniting under the <b>Arrajnord</b>, a legendary figure who led a guerrilla campaign in the hills. Though they staved off annihilation, much of their eastern territory was lost to the Sultanate, fueling a blood-feud that persists to the modern day.</p>

<h2>Culture & Demographics</h2>

<p>Arevi society is a product of the harsh <b>Berberan Desert</b> and mountain slopes. Their survival depends on communal strength rather than individual ambition.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Meritocracy:</b> There is no room for incompetence; leaders are chosen based on their ability to ensure the tribe's survival.</li>
    <li><b>Gender Roles:</b> Virtually non-existent in combat and labor roles; the necessity of supernatural strength and survival skills overrides traditional biological distinctions.</li>
    <li><b>Economy:</b> They lack currency, relying entirely on <b>bartering</b>. Taking what is needed for the tribe's survival is not seen as theft, but as necessity.</li>
    <li><b>Horse Mastery:</b> Since stealing their first mounts from the Elves, the Arevi have become the premier horse breeders of the region, utilizing the unique soil of their hills to raise hardy, war-capable steeds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Religion</h2>
<small><i>see <a href="Arevi Shamanism" class="internal-link">Arevi Shamanism</a></i></small>
<p>Arevi faith is centered on the <b>Spirit of the Sun</b> and the spirits of the land. Their history is rarely written down due to a cultural <b>taboo</b> against recording history in their hieroglyphic script, leaving their past to be preserved by the voices of their shamans.</p>
