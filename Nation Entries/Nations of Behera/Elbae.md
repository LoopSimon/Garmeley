<p>The Elbae Sultanate, named after the ruling Dynasty is the largest elven Realm in the World, controlling the vast majority of Il-Haena, most of the eastern Coast of Behera and the Drow  <a href="Underlands" class="internal-link">Underlands</a> directly, as well as exerting significant political influence throughout its subjects, like the Tributary of <a href="Hainach" class="internal-link">Hainach</a> or the <a href="Iz-Almadus" class="internal-link">Iz-Almadus</a> Emirate. Its past has been marked by imperialist ambitions across Behera, Ilrakhan and Nirydia. The capital of the Sultanate, Jiravid, is one of the largest cities in the known world with a population of ca 140.000 citizens.</p>

<h2>Economy</h2>
<p> The basis of the Elbae Sultanates economy is founded in mercantilism theory, stressing maximizing the trade inside the large country and trying to weaken international rivals, this basic mercantilist Theory was also largely imposed upon the Sultanates colonies.</p>
<p>During the 8th and 9th century, owing to a scarcity of precious metals, the economy grew faster than the money supply of the period. Few coins were in circulation and instead most transactions were made on credit, the numerous debts were usually settled during so called "Balancings" held at convenient intervals, where reciprocal debts were cancelled and only the difference had to be paid with cash, overall coins formed less than 20% of all exchanges during the period.</p>
<p>Exports increased significantly during the Modern Age, especially within the Elbae Sphere of influence, mostly privately owned companies traded with the colonies in Il-Haena, Nirydia and southern Behera.  The <a href="Grand Ziflis Company" class="internal-link">Grand Ziflix Company</a>, brought together the Sultanates leading overseas merchants in a regulated company during the middle 8th century in the nature of a guild. Its members main business was the export of cloth, and the import of a large range of foreign exotic goods. To increase beheran merchants involvement involvement in elbae trade, in 876PA a trade agreement was signed in Jiravid between the Sultanate and the <a href="Yorgos" class="internal-link">Yorgosi Marival</a>, Yorgosi merchants received privileges to carry out commercial activities within the sultanate, which in turn gained easier access to exotic beheran goods and their large gold exports.</p>

<p>The 10th century is shaping up to be a prosperous one for the elven State, as entrepreneurs extend the range of their business around the globe, the Headmaster of the Grand Ziflis Company Usval al Hamon had boasted about it "We are the most naturally diligent nation in the world, Vast trade, mighty wealth, rich manufactures and universal correspondence have been constant companions of Elbaes industrious citizens!" </p>
<h1>History</h1>
<small><i>see <a href="Rulers of the Beheran Elves" class="internal-link">Rulers of the Beheran Elves</a></i></small>
<h3>The Rise of Elbae</h3>
<p>Izzmu Alik, Head of the Elbae Dominion, which controlled the lands around Corbaik in the southern Deserts, during the later years of the Meter Dynasty, was a  gifted Politician and Spellbinder during the turn of the millennium.  Similar to most other surviving heads of families during the Great Fall of the Meter and the Eruption of Al-Akka, he had managed to find refugee in the underland Tomb City in time to avoid the most devastating fallout. Owing to ruthless opportunism and a powerful economic position, the Elbae dominion managed to assert its way over the other surviving splinters of the lost Elfrealm in Behera, notable defeating the drow Wizard Abghazi in 22PA at the height of the the Wars of Ash in a personal duel. The Elbae established themselves as the successors to the Meter in 64PA, however Izzmu declared himself as Sultan instead of the ancient elvish title Jesshera. This rejection of uniform tradition with the pre Eruption Governance of the lands would be one of many in an effort to not only distance himself from the Meter line that was now viewed as cursed and unbecoming, but also to assert his dynasties rule as a final achievement and something greater than those that had come before.</p>
<h3>Lizun the Fair & the Paragon cult</h3>
<p>Lizun ascended the White Chair of Jiravid as the first of his name and the 4th Sultan of the Elbae in 320PA following his grandfathers, Merilas II, passing a year prior. Shortly after his ascension to power, Irimaa Anhur Elbae had awakened as a living Paragon and been enshrined within her Mausoleum in the Tomb City Biarol, below Biardarkyr. Irimaas Awakening would be the last officially recorded instance of this phenomenon as, in what likely was an effort to deify his whole bloodline further, Lizun declared the so called Doctrine of Elbae Exceptionalism, that would declare that henceforth only a blood relative of the Elbae line could possibly be considered worthy enough to be declared as a Paragon of elvenkind. While Lizuns power was absolute and unquestioned in practice, many criticized this decision even in Lizuns times, the Poet Orivin being a famous example of a  contemporary dissent. Those of Orivins mind called it a failed show of power that would not only permanently weaken the Sultanate in the future but also destroy and corrupt one of the single longest existing cultural practices within their entire species while at the same time failing at its purpose of power projection, instead betraying a frail weakness and narcissism within the Sultans Heart. Orivin would be exiled for over 30 years to the colonies where his poems and writings gradually shifted and embraced Lizuns rule and decision as wise all along, but he would never again return to the Beheran homelands and die in exile.</p>
