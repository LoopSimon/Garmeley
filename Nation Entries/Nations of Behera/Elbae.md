<p>The Elbae Sultanate, named after the ruling Dynasty is the largest elven Realm in the World, controlling the vast majority of Il-Haena, most of the eastern Coast of Behera and the Drow  <a href="Underlands" class="internal-link">Underlands</a> directly, as well as exerting significant political influence throughout its subjects, like the Tributary of <a href="Hainach" class="internal-link">Hainach</a> or the <a href="Iz-Almadus" class="internal-link">Iz-Almadus</a> Emirate. Its past has been marked by imperialist ambitions across Behera, Ilrakhan and Nirydia.</p>

<h2>Economy</h2>
<p> The basis of the Elbae Sultanates economy is founded in mercantilism theory, stressing maximizing the trade inside the large country and trying to weaken international rivals, this basic mercantilist Theory was also largely imposed upon the Sultanates colonies.</p>
<p>During the 8th and 9th century, owing to a scarcity of precious metals, the economy grew faster than the money supply of the period. Few coins were in circulation and instead most transactions were made on credit, the numerous debts were usually settled during so called "Balancings" held at convenient intervals, where reciprocal debts were cancelled and only the difference had to be paid with cash, overall coins formed less than 20% of all exchanges during the period.</p>
<p>Exports increased significantly during the Modern Age, especially within the Elbae Sphere of influence, mostly privately owned companies traded with the colonies in Il-Haena, Nirydia and southern Behera.  The <a href="Grand Ziflis Company" class="internal-link">Grand Ziflix Company</a>, brought together the Sultanates leading overseas merchants in a regulated company during the middle 8th century in the nature of a guild. Its members main business was the export of cloth, and the import of a large range of foreign exotic goods. To increase beheran merchants involvement involvement in elbae trade, in 876PA a trade agreement was signed in Jiravid between the Sultanate and the <a href="Yorgos" class="internal-link">Yorgosi Marival</a>, Yorgosi merchants received privileges to carry out commercial activities within the sultanate, which in turn gained easier access to exotic beheran goods and their large gold exports.</p>

<p>The 10th century is shaping up to be a prosperous one for the elven State, as entrepreneurs extend the range of their business around the globe, the Headmaster of the Grand Ziflis Company Usval al Hamon had boasted about it "We are the most naturally diligent nation in the world, Vast trade, mighty wealth, rich manufactures and universal correspondence have been constant companions of Elbaes industrious citizens!" </p>
