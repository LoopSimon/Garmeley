<p>In the far east lie the lands of Kherova around the grand lake Kher. The last bulwark of the so called civilized world, the people of Kherova have long kept to themselves and value tradition, honesty and hard work. An oddity in the grande stage of the Continent, Kherova is the only country in the world where <a href="Human" class="internal-link">humans</a> and <a href="Deepfolk" class="internal-link">dwarves</a> coexist in every place of society in a synallagma that predates most of history.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Geography</h3>
<p>The defining feature of Kherova is the great Lake Kher, which sits in the Kher-Basin at the southern slopes of the Mistspires. Often described as the Kher Sea, it is the world's largest lake by far and reaches depths of over 1000 metres.</p>
<p>The Kulum Lowlands in the south are the country's access to the rich trade of the Pilvian Gulf and the climate grows notably warmer here, whereas the eastern half of the nation reaches into the <a href="Nirydia" class="internal-link">Nirydian Steppe</a> and the desolated northern wastes of Thamiras Rest.</p>
<p>The lake itself is also bordered by the smaller Kurini mountains in the south.</p>
<p>Central Kherova is hilly and temperate, the lake itself creating a very welcoming and hospitable climate.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Demographics</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of a central census like in countries population numbers are merely estimates here, but the largest settlements have known to conduct countings of their own, so we can estimate a population of above 2 million.</p>
<p>Around 75% of the country's citizens are kher human, while kher dwarves make up almost the entire remaining quarter, although <a href="Orc" class="internal-link">orcish</a> and half orcish minorities are prominent in the southern towns.</p>
<p>The capital and largest city, Kher itself, is home to almost 60000 souls, making it one of the largest human settlements on the continent, while the towns of Erbil and Kairos are also sizable communities of likely between 15 and 20 thousand people.</p>
<p>The Dwarven Hold of Daban-Kol makes up for a vast majority of the dwarvish population of the country but still many humans have made their home here as well.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Religion</h3>
<small><i>see <a href="Kethricism" class="internal-link">Kethricism</a></i></small>
<p>Almost the entire country worships the state religion, the Gethric denomination of <a href="Kethricism" class="internal-link">Kethricism</a>, with the head of the church being the Patriarch of Kher.</p>
<p>Remnants of Spiritworship are still present however, especially in very isolated communities like the mountain villages south of Lake Kher.</p>
<p>The country's power rests clearly within the hands of the Khat, the absolute ruler of Kherova, however the Patriarch of kher and the Kethricist Clergy enjoy many privileges and great influence, making them the strongest institution of the country after the actual government.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Politics</h3>
<p>Kherova is ruled by the Kath, currently Tiblin IX of the Heriod Dynasty that took power in the late 7th century PA.</p>
<p>The Khat of Kherova has always been a descendant of the legendary Hero Khariel, who slew the Wyrm Thamira and married her half-dragon daughter in the events of the legendary poem, “The fated journey of Khariel”.</p>
<p>The largest power struggle within the country is that of the Akaz of <a href="Daban-Kol" class="internal-link">Daban-Kol</a> and the Patriarch of Kher, so the conflict at the foot of the Throne between dwarves and Clergy.</p>
<p>This has stemmed largely from the divide between the fully integrated kheri dwarves of the country, and the more isolated citizens and population of Daban-Kol, especially as the current Patriarch Vitrik I is himself a dwarf who has made no secret of his disapproval of the semi autonomous status of the Hold.</p>
<p>The largest noble houses of Kherova enjoy an immense amount of power and leeway, namely the of Erbil, Zigrati, Iblisi and Adsali with especially the Zigrati making up the largest opposition to the crown due to a dormant and mostly ignored claim to the Throne itself.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The Founding of Kher in the 13th century BA, over two thousand years ago, marks it as one of if not the oldest human fortified settlements that still exists to this day.</p>
<p>Owing to the oral traditions of the many ancient kheri tribes and city states, barely any history is still accounted for to this day, so only very important myths like the Journey of Khariel are still known to us in the modern days.</p>
<p>However, <a href="Rakh" class="internal-link">Rakhian</a> accounts of conflicts at the border with their ancient empire in the Pilvian Province with the even then defensive and unbreakable kherovan tribes still exist.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous recorded event is the rise of the Sorcerer Merzigal, in the northern city of Alahmid, who is said to have extended his life by making sacrifices to monstrous entities, engaging freely in Hemomancy and consulting with demons.</p>
<p>The details of his eventual demise at the hands of heroes is sadly lost to us as the <a href="Kherovan Inquisition" class="internal-link">Kherovan Inquisition</a> has largely purged public knowledge of the time after destroying and salting the remnants of Alahmid in the 5th century.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Formation of the modern state of Kherova</h3>
<p>Kherovan History as a country largely begins with the victory over the expansionist kingdom of <a href="Rean" class="internal-link">Rean</a>, when the cities of Kher, Erbil and Kairos united to beat back the invading westerners in the Battle at the Yevan River in 156PA.</p>
<p>In the following decades the once warring city states began to unite to further trade and agreed on permanent defensive pacts.</p>
<p>This lose alliance of city-states agreed to help the friendly dwarves of Daban-Kol in their war with the northern Hold of <a href="Tizin-Kol" class="internal-link">Tizin-Kol</a> and upon the conclusion of the conflict the four settlements permanently united under the Rule of Kher as the strongest and richest city on the Day of Brothers in 262PA, still celebrated every year to this day.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Division from Gethricism</h3>
<p>During the days of the Gethric Mission, the people of Kherova adopted the principles of the Religion but incorporated cultural and religious beliefs of their own into the philosophy and rejected the authority of a foreign Clergy in <a href="Vihr" class="internal-link">Iztaw</a>, instead referring to the first Bishops of Kher as the Patriarch and head of Church, causing the birth of Kethricist belief; over the centuries the two denominations would drift apart further and further, leading to a declaration of full independence from the Vihri Church in 471PA and the foundation of what is now known as <a href="Kethricism" class="internal-link">Kethricism</a>.</p>
<p>This division was largely caused due to the radical views of Kherova on arcane practice in opposition to the accepting views of the Iztaw Clergy on the matter;</p>
<p>Long had Arcane Magic been labelled as unnatural and occult, especially after the tyranny of Merzigal of Alahmid and subsequent bans and persecution of “occultists” as these dangerous individuals were called.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Relations with the orcs</h3>
<p>After the destruction of the orcish tribes of <a href="Wermia" class="internal-link">Wermia</a> (specifically the tribes of Qa) and their exodus to the <a href="Qahori" class="internal-link">Qahori</a> Archipelago south of the Kurini Mountain range, Kherova has taken a largely friendly and sympathetic stance to the newly established <a href="Qahori" class="internal-link">Qahori Federation</a>.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Wars of Elbaean agression</h3>
<p>When the elven <a href="Elbae" class="internal-link">Sultanat</a> attacked <a href="Grevenna" class="internal-link">Grevenna</a> in what is now known as the 1st War of Elbae in 750PA, Kherovan forces joined in the defensive coalition together with the nations of <a href="Vihr" class="internal-link">Vihr</a> and <a href="Grachy" class="internal-link">Grachy</a> to defend their neighbour.</p>
<p>After the conclusion of the war and the defeat of the Sultanate, Kherova gained international renown for its fierce warriors and extremely useful anti-magical expertise against the magical supremacy of the Sultanate.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, Kherovan troops were once again ready to defend their western allies during the 2nd Elbae Invasion disaster struck: the ancient enemies to the east, the <a href="Kobold" class="internal-link">Kobold</a> Khans of <a href="Nirydia" class="internal-link">Nirydia</a> had united for the first time in recorded history under a creature by the name of Jigallor, his grandson had since taken control of this Khaganate and used the distracted position of Kherova to strike the eastern cities in 782PA.</p>
<p>Jigallors Horde devastated eastern Kherova, destroying the Fortress Cities of Adsal and Iblis, laying waste to Dalkil and laying siege to Erbil, one of the three jewels of Kherova.</p>
<p>The Invaders were beaten back, the siege relieved and Jigallor fell during the Battle of Erbil, however the sudden retreat of the extremely valuable kherovan forces spelled Doom for <a href="Grevenna" class="internal-link">Grevenna</a>, and was largely responsible for the loss of the 2nd War of Elbae Aggression leading to hostilities and enmity between Grevenna and Kherova to this date.</p>
<p>Kherova would not join the 3rd Coalition and maintain neutral relations to the <a href="Elbae" class="internal-link">Sultanat</a>, even going so far as to refuse to sign the <a href="Treaty of Danipol" class="internal-link">Treaty of Danipol</a> in 815PA.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Fall of Kulum</h3>
<p>In the Year 820PA the centuries old port City of Kulum, access point to Pilvian Gulf and all southern trade, gave rise to one of the most infamous Arcanists in known history: Ahrmiz Saceren also known as Ahrmiz the Conjurer.</p>
<p>His cult renounced the Kethricist principles and more or less enslaved the city, abusing a Crisis of government in Kher.</p>
<p>Ahrmiz ruled Kulum with fear but also a promise of worldly power, gathering a surprising amount of followers around him; it was only due to a party of brave heroes and the actions of the empowered <a href="Kherovan Inquisition" class="internal-link">Kherovan Inquisition</a> that what remained of Kulum could be freed, and although the Cult itself split apart and survived only in hiding, rumours of Ahrmiz's promised resurrection through occult means still persist.</p>
<p>The Inquisition ruled the city lost to the lingering curses and the Kherovan Government sponsored the settlement of New Kulum which grew rapidly in the last century.</p>
<p>The <a href="Treaty of Kulum" class="internal-link">Treaty of Kulum</a>, signed as a result of this crisis by most nations on the continent, gave Kherovan Inquisitors international legal authority to apprehend remnants of the Cult, a practice that is often criticised by local lords and authorities as well abused by individual agents of the Inquisition that use it as an opportunity to enact secret missions and witch-hunts across the Continent.</p>
