<p>One of the largest nations in not just <a href="Ilrakhan" class="internal-link">Ilrakhan</a> but all <a href="Inara" class="internal-link">Inara</a>, Vihr lays claim to the lands between Mistspires and Grachhyll in the East and the Trollback Mountains in the west while considering the former Lands of <a href="Wermia" class="internal-link">Wermia</a>, although largely uninhabitable, in the North, as well as southern end of the Vihri Expanse up until the Pilv River part of their domain.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Geography</h3>
<p>The Climate in Vihr is temperate transitional and varies from oceanic in the north and south to continental in the central regions.</p>
<p>Forests occupy a decent amount of Vihrs land area, the larges of which is the Ravenleaf Forest in the southeast.</p>
<p>The Plains of the Vihri Expanse, between the three mighty Rivers Lehva, Tryda and Opuzna are flat and temperate, offering rich farmlands and in the southern parts the wide grasslands of the Vihri Unicorn, the national animal of the Kingdom.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Demographics</h3>
<p>Vihr is the largest nation on <a href="Ilrakhan" class="internal-link">Ilrakhan</a>, as far as population is concerned, and primarily made up of a Vihri <a href="Human" class="internal-link">Human</a> Majority, with <a href="Wermia" class="internal-link">Wermian</a>, <a href="Rean" class="internal-link">Reani</a> and <a href="Grachy" class="internal-link">Grachi</a> Human making up sizeable minorities and are higher than usual population of <a href="Deepfolk" class="internal-link">Dwarves</a> within the settlements bordering the friendly Holds of <a href="Tizin-Kol" class="internal-link">Tizin-Kol</a> and <a href="Xer-Kol" class="internal-link">Xer-Kol</a>.</p>
<p>Gnomish and Halfling minorities are present but rare within the country.</p>
<p>There are almost no <a href="Elf" class="internal-link">elven</a> or half-elven citizens present within the Kingdom, largely due to the Gethric Progoms of the 9th century.</p>

<h3>Politics</h3>
<p>The Kingdom of Vihr is ruled by the Kings in Zavlech, currently Miskomir IV of House Ralpia and has been since its founding in the middle of the 3rd century PA.</p>
<p>The Power in Vihr is largely if not entirely in the hands of the <a href="Church of Iztaw" class="internal-link">Church of Iztaw</a> and the Aristocracy who are unified in the Honoured Assembly, an old institution with roots in Vihrmen tradition from before the foundation of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Periods of Vihri History are often defined by the Kings relationship with the High-Bishop of Iztaw, and the silent power struggle between Iztaw and Zavlech.</p>
<p>In current times the High-Bishop is seen as a figure of influence and importance at the court, but power rests firmly within the Hands of King Miskomir IV.</p>
