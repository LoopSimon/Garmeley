<p>One of the largest nations in not just <a href="Ilrakhan" class="internal-link">Ilrakhan</a> but all <a href="Inara" class="internal-link">Inara</a>, Vihr lays claim to the lands between Mistspires and Grachhyll in the East and the Trollback Mountains in the west while considering the former Lands of <a href="Wermia" class="internal-link">Wermia</a>, although largely uninhabitable, in the North, as well as southern end of the Vihri Expanse up until the Pilv River part of their domain.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Climate in Vihr is temperate transitional and varies from oceanic in the north and south to continental in the central regions.</p>
<p>Forests occupy a decent amount of Vihrs land area, the larges of which is the Ravenleaf Forest in the southeast.</p>
<p>The Plains of the Vihri Expanse, between the three mighty Rivers Lehva, Tryda and Opuzna are flat and temperate, offering rich farmlands and in the southern parts the wide grasslands of the Vihri Unicorn, the national animal of the Kingdom.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>Vihr is the largest nation on <a href="Ilrakhan" class="internal-link">Ilrakhan</a>, as far as population is concerned, and primarily made up of a Vihri <a href="Human" class="internal-link">Human</a> Majority, with <a href="Wermia" class="internal-link">Wermian</a>, <a href="Rean" class="internal-link">Reani</a> and <a href="Grachy" class="internal-link">Grachi</a> Human making up sizeable minorities and are higher than usual population of <a href="Deepfolk" class="internal-link">Dwarves</a> within the settlements bordering the friendly Holds of <a href="Tizin-Kol" class="internal-link">Tizin-Kol</a> and <a href="Xer-Kol" class="internal-link">Xer-Kol</a>.</p>
<p>Gnomish and Halfling minorities are present but rare within the country.</p>
<p>There are almost no <a href="Elf" class="internal-link">elven</a> or half-elven citizens present within the Kingdom, largely due to the Gethric Progoms of the 9th century.</p>

<h2>Politics</h2>
<p>The Kingdom of Vihr is ruled by the Kings in Zavlech, currently Miskomir IV of House Ralpia and has been since its founding in the middle of the 3rd century PA.</p>
<p>The Power in Vihr is largely if not entirely in the hands of the <a href="Church of Iztaw" class="internal-link">Church of Iztaw</a> and the Aristocracy who are unified in the Honoured Assembly, an old institution with roots in Vihrmen tradition from before the foundation of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Periods of Vihri History are often defined by the Kings relationship with the High-Bishop of Iztaw, and the silent power struggle between Iztaw and Zavlech.</p>
<p>In current times the High-Bishop is seen as a figure of influence and importance at the court, but power rests firmly within the Hands of King Miskomir IV.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Unification Period</h3>
<p>The history of the Vihr Kingdom is inevitably linked to the history of the Gethric Church. The Kingdom was formed during the Wars of Unification in the middle of the 3rd century, following the end of the 2nd Wermian Incursion, when the current Lord of Zavlech, Viago I of House Zav declared himself King of all Vihrmen and started a deeply religiously motivated war of conquest alongside the spread of Gethricism as a new Religion in Ilrakhan. At the end of the Unification Period, the lands controlled by Viago largely resembled the heartlands of modern day Vihr, stretching from Iztaw to Opuzna.</p>

<h3>House of Zav (241PA - 501PA)</h3>
<p>The Tribe of Zav, lead by Viagos descendants, lived along the middle of the Tryda River and made up the largest ethnic group among Vihrmen during the first half of the Silver Age. It was only natural that with Viago I ascending to Kingship the city of Zavlech was made the formal Capital of the new Nation, replacing Tlokyemy as the centre of Vihrmen culture. This era was dominated by the spread of <a href="Gethricism" class="internal-link">Gethricism</a> and the conversion of not only the Vihrmen Lands, but also foreign entities, such as the Kherovan Khatrym, the Kingdom of Halgrach and the Kingdom of <a href="Kingdom of Rean" class="internal-link">Rean</a> to varying degrees of success.</p>

<p>It quickly became apparent to the blooming feudal nobility that the clergy—and in particular the High Bishop of Iztaw—had risen to untold influence. In response the League of Lords was formed in 377PA, pressuring the Throne of Zavlech to concede on certain demands of representation, ending in 384PA with the creation of the Honoured Assembly.</p>
<h3>House of Szinmo (501PA - 692PA)</h3>
<p>After the Zav senior line died out in 501, Vihr came under the rule of the Duke of Szievek, Kasimir of House Szinmo, a Junior Branch of the House of Zav.</p>

<h3>House of Ralpia (692PA - present)</h3>
<p>With the end of the House of Szinmo, the assembled feudal nobility under the Honoured Assembly as well as the Gethric Bishops elected Miskomir of House Ralpia, the Duke of Trazlov, as King Miskomir III of Vihr and Wermia. This was the first official claim to the Lands of <a href="Wermia" class="internal-link">Wermia</a> by the Kings of Vihr, although the Throne of Zavlech had practically asserted control over the desolated region for years prior.</p>
