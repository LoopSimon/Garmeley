<p> The Free City of Uhl, once part of the now fallen realm of <a href="Urland" class="internal-link">Urland</a>, is a Trading City on the Gullsong Sea and one of the "three great Ports" alongside Sallesand and Trazlov. Uhl is one of the largest cities in the entire known world with a population of around 100.000.</p> 

<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Uhl is especially associated with the Vrieman Banker Family and can be considered the capital of early capitalism. It has benefitted majorly from the establishment and expansion of the Urien Post, a postal service established in 913PA. The metal business of the Zelsner Family that owned the Uhl mint at Talshol is another example of an Uhlian burgher family holding a near monopoly on a certain industry, in this case the bank and metal business of the Vrieman and Zelsner has created a large economic boom within the city and attracted more and more people.</p>
