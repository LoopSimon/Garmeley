<p> Dominated by two mighty Rivers, the Mead in the west and the Trinmo to the east, the lands of the Meadi are rich and prosperous. Second only to the Gethric Kingdom of <a href="Vihr" class="internal-link">Vihr</a> in the east, Meadrath remains one of the largest human realms in the known world.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p> Most of Meadrath lies in the North-Ilrakhani Plain, with flat terrain crossed by watercourses such as the Trinmo and Mead, wetlands and marshy conditions are found close to the with <a href="Blijgrat" class="internal-link">Blijgrat</a> and along the Bloody Coast. </p>
<h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>The Majority population in Meadrath is made up of Meadi and Weadi human, with Urien Human, Half-elfs, Gnomes and Halflings making up the largest minorities. While some Trykkerogi have settled and assimilated in the northern coastal towns, they remain a small minority. <br> The traditionally lax and welcoming attitude of the Meadi Kings and Queens, in combination with the stellar reputation of the <a href="Korsfall College" class="internal-link">Korsfall College</a>, has lead to a larger than average percentage of Arcane practitioners in Meadrath, rivaled essentially only by the <a href="Elbae" class="internal-link">Elbae Sultanate.</a> </p>

<h2>Religion</h2>
<small><i>see <a href="Trinicism" class="internal-link">Trinicism</a></i></small>
<p>The vast majority of the population follows the decentralized and diverse local Churches of the Trinicist Faith, strongest in the Lands around the Trinmo and Gisvale, for it was at Trinfurt on the western border of the Kingdom that the Great Schism between the Gethric and Trinicist Church occurred at the end of the 6th century. <br> Further west, small communities and specific social demographics in the larger cities still practice <a href="Augurism" class="internal-link">Augurism</a> while almost no remnants of pre-Gethric belief such as <a href="Turvik Paganism" class="internal-link">Turvik Cults</a> can be found east of Korsfall.</p>
<h2>Politics</h2>
<p> The Kingdom of Meadrath is one of the most important political entities on Inara and the Nucleus of the "Meadi Empire" encompassing a sphere of influence stretching from Trinvale and Uhl, the Weadlands and central Meadrath all the way to the Halfling Freelands to the west. <br> The political nexus of all these nations inevitably is the Korsfall Court in the Kingdoms Capital that is dominated by the Royal Congress, a Council of dignitaries of the three estates that advises the Monarch on matters of economic, national and international policy. <br>
The so called "Meadi Empire" as it is referred to colloquially, describes the various minor or major nations and cities ruled directly or indirectly by the decisions of the Royal Court, this architecture of dependency and alliances is often referred to as the Fulmer-System, named after High-Chancellor Odrick von Fulmer who was instrumental in the creation and organization of the modern day Royal Congress.</p>


<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Gisvale & Korsfall</h3>
<p>The History of the meadi after the fall of the <a href="Auguri Dominion" class="internal-link">Auguri Dominion</a> in 260PA is one of two kingdoms.
The Kingdom of Gisvale was formed by Ardol I of House of Gismar, a descendant of the legendary hero Gismar that was said to have slain the Black <a href="Dragon" class="internal-link">Dragon Heximar.</a> The Kings of the Gisvale ruled from Giselstatt along the mighty Trinmo and were known for their close cultural association to northern  Urland, most prominently shown in their worship of the <a href="Turvik Paganism" class="internal-link">Turvik Gods.</a> Even in the days before the Fall of the Auguri, this difference in faith clearly differentiated the people of the Gisvale from their meadi and weadi cousins.</p>
<p>Unlike Gisvale, the Realm of Korsfall was very much a direct continuation of the Auguri Dominion. The earliest known record of a "Lord of all Meadi in Korsfall" is the figure of Torvald the Tall, an Auguri general that likely took power soon after 260PA and most of this early history of Korsfall describes their repeated conflicts and wars with the eastern people of the Locni Valley. The people of Korsfall very much continued the Auguri traditions, such as their reverence for medicae, scholars and mages, but of course no longer practiced religious rites as the Arrival of Gethricism had played a large part in the fall of the Dominion.</p>

<h3>The Fall and Rise of the House of Gismar</h3>
<p>At the dusk of the 6th century Tibor II, the then King of Gisvale, was betrayed and supplanted by Diedrik of Meadland, the Lord of Wormill, Tibors children would flee first to Weadland but be rejected in fear of war by the King of Schipwig and only found refuge at Korsfall Keep.
The mighty Diedrick would rule Gisvale until his death when his son Ringil, who had married an urien Princess would succeed him in 622PA. 
Tibors son, a boy called Gismar, now grown up and with children of his own, had spend the last 2 decades rallying loyalists and allies to his banner and would now, with the Lord of Korsfall at his side, dare to make a bid for the Throne in Giselstatt.
The following conflict is known to history as <a href="War of Trout and Drake" class="internal-link">The War of Trout and Drake</a> and last for over three decades. At its end, Giselstatt was conquered, the line of Diedrik extinguished and the Dragon Banner of Gismar raised in supreme victory, but not without its costs. Tens of thousands had died and the vast majority of the rich farmlands and fields of the Gisvale been devastated, Gismar himself as well as his sons had died in battle and only his daughter Liara remained.</p>
<p>And so it was that on the even of Fall, in 664PA, Liara of the House of Gismar would marry Gunther of the House of Kor, the Lord of Korsfall and her fathers strongest supporter.
Liara would be declared Queen in Giselestatt like her Grandfather had been and the two ruled the lands of Korsfall and Gisvale together. To cement the Union of the two realms their firstborn son, Giselher would be crowned as the first King of Meadrath, the unified Lands of his ancestors.</p>
