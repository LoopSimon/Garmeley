<p> Dominated by two mighty Rivers, the Mead in the west and the Trinmo to the east, the lands of the Meadi are rich and prosperous. Second only to the Gethric Kingdom of <a href="Vihr" class="internal-link">Vihr</a> in the east, Meadrath remains one of the largest human realms in the known world. The capital of Meadrath, Korsfall, is one of the largest cities in the known world with a population of ca 110.000 citizens.</p>

<h2>Geography</h2>
<p> Most of Meadrath lies in the North-Ilrakhani Plain, with flat terrain crossed by watercourses such as the Trinmo and Mead, wetlands and marshy conditions are found close to the with <a href="Blijgrat" class="internal-link">Blijgrat</a> and along the Bloody Coast. </p>
<h2>Demographics</h2>
<p>The Majority population in Meadrath is made up of Meadi and Weadi human, with Urien Human, Half-elfs, Gnomes and Halflings making up the largest minorities. While some Trykkerogi have settled and assimilated in the northern coastal towns, they remain a small minority. <br> The traditionally lax and welcoming attitude of the Meadi Kings and Queens, in combination with the stellar reputation of the <a href="Korsfall College" class="internal-link">Korsfall College</a>, has lead to a larger than average percentage of Arcane practitioners in Meadrath, rivaled essentially only by the <a href="Elbae" class="internal-link">Elbae Sultanate.</a> </p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>In the early 10th century, Meadrath alongside Blijgrat dominates Ilrakhani trade and manufacturing, merchants in Korsvale, Giselstatt and Meadhavn have developed large business organizations such as Whisperhill Shipping or the Gisvale Trade Company.  
The introduction of the high-temperature forge in the mountainous Meadrath has led to mineral mining, although the country is forced to import copper, bronze and tin from Battvia, Vihr and Urland. Mines and glasswork are benefitting greatly from royal tax exemptions since the early 10 century. Silk production, introduced in Jera, Bellhome and Praum in the late 9th century, enabled the Meadi to join a thriving market, but meadi products remain of lesser quality than Cevoli Silk, wool production is widespread in the country, just like the production of linen and hemp; all major export production. </p>

<p>Giselstatt serves as the center of Meadrath`s banking and international trade markets, fairs occur six times a year and facilitate the export of meadi goods like the aforementioned fabrics and import of international goods as well as allowing the importation of more exotic goods from the south such as alum, glass, spices and dyes. Trade was roughly balanced with the Blijgrat League, but Meadrath ran a large trade deficit for a long time with Battvia due to the latter's silks and exotic goods, a fact that has changed in the last century due to the political control exerted on the south during the Cevolian Civil Wars.</p>
<p>In the 920s, owed to Meadraths demographic growth, its increased demand for consumer goods led to a fall in standard of living for rural peasants, who were forced to deal with bad harvests in the 910s and 20s, although many land-owning peasants and enterprising merchants had been able to grow rich during the boom. </p>
<p>Meadraths military ventures in Battvia and its civil wars demanded huge sums of cash, wich were largely raised through special taxes, financial crisis hit the royal household repeateldy in the late 9th century and one of the main tasks of the Royal Congress was to establish a government bond system on Korsfall, the "Meadi Town Hall Rent."</p> <p>

<h2>Religion</h2>
<small><i>see <a href="Trinicism" class="internal-link">Trinicism</a></i></small>
<p>The vast majority of the population follows the decentralized and diverse local Churches of the Trinicist Faith, strongest in the Lands around the Trinmo and Gisvale, for it was at Trinfurt on the western border of the Kingdom that the Great Schism between the Gethric and Trinicist Church occurred at the end of the 6th century. <br> Further west, small communities and specific social demographics in the larger cities still practice <a href="Augurism" class="internal-link">Augurism</a> while almost no remnants of pre-Gethric belief such as <a href="Turvik Paganism" class="internal-link">Turvik Cults</a> can be found east of Korsfall.</p>
<h2>Politics</h2>
<p> The Kingdom of Meadrath is one of the most important political entities on Inara and the Nucleus of the "Meadi Empire" encompassing a sphere of influence stretching from Trinvale and Uhl, the Weadlands and central Meadrath all the way to the Halfling Freelands to the west. <br> The political nexus of all these nations inevitably is the Korsfall Court in the Kingdoms Capital that is dominated by the Royal Congress, a Council of dignitaries of the three estates that advises the Monarch on matters of economic, national and international policy. <br>
The so called "Meadi Empire" as it is referred to colloquially, describes the various minor or major nations and cities ruled directly or indirectly by the decisions of the Royal Court, this architecture of dependency and alliances is often referred to as the Fulmer-System, named after High-Chancellor Odrick von Fulmer who was instrumental in the creation and organization of the modern day Royal Congress.</p>


<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Gisvale & Korsfall</h3>
<p>The History of the meadi after the fall of the <a href="Auguri Dominion" class="internal-link">Auguri Dominion</a> in 260PA is one of two kingdoms.
The Kingdom of Gisvale was formed by Ardol I of House of Gismar, a descendant of the legendary hero Gismar that was said to have slain the Black <a href="Dragon" class="internal-link">Dragon Heximar.</a> The Kings of the Gisvale ruled from Giselstatt along the mighty Trinmo and were known for their close cultural association to northern  Urland, most prominently shown in their worship of the <a href="Turvik Paganism" class="internal-link">Turvik Gods.</a> Even in the days before the Fall of the Auguri, this difference in faith clearly differentiated the people of the Gisvale from their meadi and weadi cousins.</p>
<p>Unlike Gisvale, the Realm of Korsfall was very much a direct continuation of the Auguri Dominion. The earliest known record of a "Lord of all Meadi in Korsfall" is the figure of Torvald the Tall, an Auguri general that likely took power soon after 260PA and most of this early history of Korsfall describes their repeated conflicts and wars with the eastern people of the Locni Valley. The people of Korsfall very much continued the Auguri traditions, such as their reverence for medicae, scholars and mages, but of course no longer practiced religious rites as the Arrival of Gethricism had played a large part in the fall of the Dominion.</p>

<h3>The Fall and Rise of the House of Gismar</h3>
<p>At the dusk of the 6th century Tibor II, the then King of Gisvale, was betrayed and supplanted by Diedrik of Meadland, the Lord of Wormill, Tibors children would flee first to Weadland but be rejected in fear of war by the King of Schipwig and only found refuge at Korsfall Keep.
The mighty Diedrick would rule Gisvale until his death when his son Ringil, who had married an urien Princess would succeed him in 622PA. 
Tibors son, a boy called Gismar, now grown up and with children of his own, had spend the last 2 decades rallying loyalists and allies to his banner and would now, with the Lord of Korsfall at his side, dare to make a bid for the Throne in Giselstatt.
The following conflict is known to history as <a href="War of Trout and Drake" class="internal-link">The War of Trout and Drake</a> and last for over three decades. At its end, Giselstatt was conquered, the line of Diedrik extinguished and the Dragon Banner of Gismar raised in supreme victory, but not without its costs. Tens of thousands had died and the vast majority of the rich farmlands and fields of the Gisvale been devastated, Gismar himself as well as his sons had died in battle and only his daughter Liara remained.</p>
<p>And so it was that on the even of Fall, in 664PA, Liara of the House of Gismar would marry Gunther of the House of Kor, the Lord of Korsfall and her fathers strongest supporter.
Liara would be declared Queen in Giselestatt like her Grandfather had been and the two ruled the lands of Korsfall and Gisvale together. To cement the Union of the two realms their firstborn son, Gildher would be crowned as the first King of Meadrath, the unified Lands of his ancestors.</p>
<h3>Gisela I & the Rise of Trinicism</h3>
<p>In the year 704PA, Gisela of House Kor would be crowned Queen Gisela I of Meadrath, after the death of her father, Gildher II. Her reign lasted for over 68 years and usher in an age of prosperity and progress for the meadi people that would leave the Kingdom as one of the premier powers of the Inaran continent. During her formative years as a young monarch, Gisela succesfully confronted rebellious vassals and was guided by her mother, the late Queen-Mother Margaret of Jera.</p>
<p>Gisela instigated significant reforms in the meadi legal system, creating a royal judiciary and institutions of appeal to the court directly, while abolishing trials by ordeal, to institute her new legal reforms and administer the country more effectively, she established the office of the bailiff.
Giselas expanded upon the work of her father and grandfather and would further sponsor and expand the  <a href="Korsfall College" class="internal-link">College at Korsfall</a> and earn a reputation as a fair, judicious and scholarly Ruler across Ilrakhan.
</p>
<p>A few years after the outbreak of <a href="Wars of Elbae Aggression" class="internal-link">first Elbae War</a> the High-Bishop of <a href="Church of Iztaw" class="internal-link">Iztaw</a> woudl declare the Gethric Progroms, a series of mandates to banish and persecute elves and half-elves across all lands of the devout. This would cause great uproar within many regional Churches, especially around northern Urland and in the western regions of Meadrath and Cevolis where the Clergy of Iztaw had long been viewed as either corrupt politicians or petty servants of the Kings of <a href="Vihr" class="internal-link">Vihr</a>. In response to the Bull, many Bishops of the Church would gather at Trinfurt in 764 PA and debate for months the divine justice of not only such a progrom but also the role of the bishop, the view on the arcane and divine and the Hierarchy within the clergy.
When Knights of the <a href="The Order of the Silver Wheel" class="internal-link">Order of the Silver Wheel</a> would attempts to forcefully disband the Gathering, Gisela supported local guards and adventurers that defended the priests successfully. The Great Schism between the east and the west that would occur and later lead to the Trinicist denomination of Gethric belief is a direct consequence of the Conclave.<p>

<h3>The Meadi Empire</h3>
In the later years of the 9th century, Meadraths influence had only grown and it was now considered one of the "Great Three Powers" alongside the beheran Sultantate and the Vihri Kingdom. 
The late Queen Gisela IV, of the Kor Junior Branch of Orvan, had instituted the Royal Congress under the leadership of the Count of Fulmer, now declared High-Chancellor, in the year 895PA.
While on paper a merely internal body of administration and efficiency, in essence this Congress enforced Meadi influence and power upon its neighbours through soft power and is largely responsible for the extensive centralization of political power in Korsfall and the "Meadi Empire", which refers to the control over Sallesand, Blijgrat, the Halfling Freelands and various other nominally fully independent nations.
