<p>The Principalities of Ukiolla are deeply connected to the old traditions of the Pekhi tribes and the lands of the Aeldveil. Ukiolla has been engaged in constant conflict with its southern neighbour in Grachy but enjoys a healthy relationship with goblin traders from the Mistspires and the <a href="Juelfluk" class="internal-link">Jueli</a> Sailors.  </p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Ukiolla lies east of the Torn Sea and South of the Eldveil, although many would consider the forest and the icy plains to its north part of the Principality.
While the southern parts of Ukiolla are still predominantly agricultural, forest coverage gradually increases the further north and east the country stretches, around 50% of Ukiollas total land area is covered with forests. The countries dominant river, the Asza, is sourced from within the Mistspires and acts as an important economic waterway that connects the inland industries and settlements with the ports of the west.</p>
<p>Winters, particularly in the north, define the year and can last up to 130 days, the winters are  long and cold and the summers are war but short, the winters up close to the Eldveil can last up to 150 days. The climate in Ukiolla is mostly suitable for cereal farming although the northern areas are only suitable for animal husbandry due to the harsher climate.</p>
<h2>Demographics</h2>

<p>Approximating the Ukiollan population is almost impossible due to there being no official census and the country being very decentralized in general.  Around 90% of the countries population is made up by Pehki Humans, the natives of not only modern day Ukiolla but also the lands further south where the Grachy Republic now rules. The Sehvki, men of the mountains, make up most of  the remaining population. Their relationship with the pekhi is amicable but clearly defined, as they live mostly isolated and in small communities, usually at the slopes of the Mistspires or within the reaches of the Eldveil. There are some northern Sehvki tribes that roam the Waelajokull, but contact with them is rare and it would be hard to describe them as citizens of the Principality.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Having undergone large reforms in recent times, the Ukiollan economy is in a state of change. The Green Tithe, a simplification and standardization of taxes and levies is a recent introduction to the realm, increasing crown tax revenue and balancing the pay between nobility and farmer within the country. This assessment of tax based on ability to pay is  welcomed by many and perceived as fair and just.</p>
<p>Mercantilism and Trade is a larger part of ukiollan economy than one might expect on first glance. The port of Hakkepenki may not be as large as Sallesand or Uhl, but it is large destination for Jueli Traders nonetheless. The recent reignition of the <a href="Great Eastern War" class="internal-link">War with Grachy</a>, has however led to a stagnation of Trade as ukiolland merchants are not welcome in Grachy and the sea routes have become less safe for pehki traders.</p>
<p>The Ukiollan economy is almost entirely agrarian, exporting mainly livestock, fur, fish and Copper.
The incredible amount of untapped timber of the highest quality within the country has been the source of conflict with its neighbours as religious and cultural traditions forbid the pehki from harming the plant life of the region.
On the flipside, many beaver and bear pelts of great refine are exported alongside rare minerals such as copper and tin. On the grand scale of things the Ukiollan economy is however undeniably poor, owing certainly to the isolation of its traders due to the conflict with Grachy as discussed above. 
Nevertheless, the land provides for the pehki and sevhki that care for it, as Ukiolla is perhaps the only country in the known world where the relationship between state and clergy, or in this case the druidic circles of <a href="Aeldcult" class="internal-link">the Aeldcult</a>, has resulted in a real positive for the agricultural economy of the country: famines are almost non existent within Ukiolla, the lands around the Asza are unnaturally fertile and warm, especially for the climate, and the animals are fertile and healthy.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<small><i>see <a href="Aeldcult" class="internal-link">the Aeldcult</a></i></small>
<p>Initial attempts of converting the Pehki and Sevhki peoples to Gethricism in the 4th century failed quickly due to the deep roots of the Aeldcult within the smallest social structures of the tribes and later wars with the predominantly Gethric Grachi only proofed to bolster the internal resistance against this foreign faith, which became unanimous with the symbol fo the southern invaders that had taken the land of the pehki.
The first druid of the Aeld, is a position that is almost as influential as the Prince within the greater cultural context of Ukiolla and she is traditionally married to the Halontsaari monarch, giving him legitimacy among his people and reinforcing the "Great Promise", the task to protect the lands of the Eldveil from southern heathens.</p>
