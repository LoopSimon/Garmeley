<p>South of the splintered lands of <a href="Urland" class="internal-link">Urland</a> lies the rich and peaceful Duchy of Garmeley, an independent nation profiting from arable land, rich silver mines and trade with all of its neighbours.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The Tribes of Garm were subjugated by the <a href="Rakh" class="internal-link">Rakhian Empire</a> in the early 3rd Century BA, with many of the old Rakhian roads still in use to this day. During the height of the Rakhian dominance the Province of Garm was no longer considered a borderland but instead a core part of the Empire.</p>

<p>After the Eruption of Al-Akka and the end of the Rakhian Empire, the native tribes of Garm rose up against the remaining Rakhian people in union with the newly formed Kingdom of <a href="Urland" class="internal-link">Urland</a>. Alfin I was crowned as the first Riverking of Garm in matrimony with the Nyad Zivalla and entered into the Old Pact, vowing to protect the Gladewood in exchange for the cooperation of the <a href="Kindly Lords" class="internal-link">Kindly Lords</a>.</p>

<p>With the death of King Ahlef II at the <b>Battle of Greyfields</b> (648PA), the line of Alfin ended. The successor, Tyla of Aldale, chose to reject the crown and instead proclaim herself <b>Duchess of Garmeley</b> to prevent a fatal civil war. Under the subsequent rule of Dukes Albrecht V, Eadwin II, and the current <b>Duchess Agnes I</b>, the land has enjoyed over a century of peace.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Geography</h3>
<p>Garmeley borders the minor Urlandi Kingdoms of <a href="Trinvale" class="internal-link">Calmbrook</a> and Niedmer in the North-West, the Kingdom of Gethria in the East and <a href="Hainach" class="internal-link">Hainach</a> in the South. It encapsulates the entirety of the <b>Gladewood</b> and is bordered by the Stormy Sea and the Trollback Mountains.</p>

<p>The nation is defined by its rivers, notably the <b>Melm</b> and the <b>Trinmo</b> (the largest river in the known world), which flows into Lake Forr. The <b>Garmian Planes</b> in the south represent the lowest and most arable elevation of the country, while the <b>Thull</b> river serves as the major economic trade route.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Politics</h3>
<p>The Duchy is ruled through <b>absolute cognatic primogeniture</b>. Since the transition from a Kingdom to a Duchy, power has become less centralized, with feudal lords enjoying significant autonomy. The primary nobility form the <b>Council of Lords</b>, including the Counts of Melmbirth, Forrington, Tewkford, and Sunminster.</p>

<p>Garmeley maintains strong alliances with <a href="Trinvale" class="internal-link">Calmbrook</a>, <a href="Hainach" class="internal-link">Hainach</a>, and <a href="Gelmsburg" class="internal-link">Gelmsburg</a>, and acts as the official <b>Defender of the City of Reanport</b>. The <b>College of Patwin Tower</b> regulates magical affairs, adhering to the <a href="Wermian Accords" class="internal-link">Wermian Accords</a>.</p>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Demographics</h3>
<p>The population is estimated at <b>2.4 million</b>. The largest city is <b>Forrington</b> (44k), followed by the capital <b>Redflow</b> (31k). While <a href="Reanport" class="internal-link">Reansport</a> is not officially part of the Duchy, it houses nearly 29k citizens and remains under Garmian protection.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Humans:</b> Garmian majority, with Urian and Hainachi minorities.</li>
    <li><b>Dwarves:</b> Sizable populations in Dolm and Whistlemine.</li>
    <li><b>Gnomes & Elves:</b> Mostly concentrated in Redflow and Jorrenstead.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="wiki-hr">
<h3>Religion</h3>
<small><i>see <a href="Kindly Lords" class="internal-link">Kindly Lords</a></i></small>
<p>The state religion is the worship of the <b>Kindly Lords of Glade and River</b>, overseen by the Leafpriests of Sunminster. While the <a href="Gods of Forge and Fire" class="internal-link">Gods of Forge and Fire</a> are respected, <a href="Gethricism" class="internal-link">Gethric</a> communities are merely tolerated for diplomatic reasons. Small <a href="Elf" class="internal-link">Elven</a> minorities continue to uphold the faith of the Paragons of <a href="Elbae" class="internal-link">Elbae</a>.</p>
