History

The Tribes of Garm were subjugated by the Rakhian Empire in the early 3rd Century BA, with many of the old Rakhian roads still in use to this day.  
During the height of the Rakhian dominance the Province of Garm was no longer considered a borderland but instead a core part of the Empire, as expansion continued into the northern lands of Urland.

After the Eruption of Al-Akka and the end of the Rakhian Empire, the native tribes of Garm rose up against the remaining Rakhian people in union with the newly formed Kingdom of Urland and proclaimed that from now on they would rule themselves independantly.

  

Alfin I was crowned as the first Riverking of Garm in matrimony with the Nyad Zivalla and entered into the Old Pact, vowing to protect and  never settle the Gladewood in exchange for the cooperation of the Kindly Lords, or so legend says. 

  

With the death of King Ahlef II of Garm at the battle of Greyfields in 648PA, the unbroken line of Alfin and Zivalla was ended and the young Tyla of Aldale was chosen as the successor to the Riverthrone of Redflow as a cousin twice removed of Ahlef. 

While Tyla had the majority of the nobility and Kingdom on her side, she chose to reject the Crown and instead proclaim herself Duchess of Garmeley, not River Queen in an effort to unite her people and prevent a civil war that would have been fatal for the Kingdom considering the hardfought peace with Gethria in the years prior.

  

The Foundation of Jorrenstead and the purchase of Dolm have made the Duchy a considerable power in recent times, and under the Dukes Albrecht V, Eadwin II and the Duchess Agnes I, Garmeley has been enjoying a time of peace for over 100 years.

  
  
  
  
  
  

Geography

  

Garmeley borders the minor Urlandi Kingdoms of Calmbrook and Niedmer in the North-West, the Kingdom of Gethria in the East and Hainach in the South.

It borders both the Stormy Sea, the Ironwood as well as the Southern Trollback Mountains and encapsulates the entirety of the Gladewood.

Garmeley is defined by its Rivers, namely the Melm and the Trinmo, which takes its waters into Lake Forr and ends in the Stormy Sea. The Trinmo has its largest width in Garmeley and is the largest River in the known world.

The Northern Garmeley is much more elevated than its southern parts due to the slopes of the Trollback Mountains and the central Barrens Hills.

Lake Forr in the South is one of the largest lakes on the Subcontinent sitting north of the rich Garmian Planes, the lowest elevation of the country and its most arable lands.

South of the Garmian Planes flows the Thull, the country's major economic trade route to the Stormy Sea and lands beyond.

  
  
  
  
  

Politics

  

The contemporary Garmeley is ruled by its Duchess or Duke from the city of Redflow, a title inherited through absolute cognatic primogeniture.  
However with the dissolution of the Kingdom of Garm and the establishment of the Duchy through one of its major houses of nobility, much of the power once centralized within the main royal line of the Riverkings has been lost and many of the feudal lords of the Duchy are enjoying a rather autonomous rule under Redflow.

The primary Nobles of Garmeley, members of the advisory Council of Lords, are the Counts of Melmbirth, Forrington, Tewkford and Sunminster, as well as the Lord-Castellan of Fellpass and the Lord-Mayors of Jorrenstead and Dolm; Patwin Tower holds an honorary seat as well.

  

Garmeley enjoys alliances with Calmbrook, Niedmer, Hainach and Gelmsburg , is on friendly terms with the Vihr Kingdom and the Sultanate and has proclaimed itself Defender of the City of Reanport.

The Duchy has sponsored multiple joint expeditions into the Rahki wastes with the Paper City of Ligoggia in the hopes of securing safe passage to the western part of the Ilrahkian Continent.

The College of Patwin tower is a relatively old institution of metaphysical, astronomical and arcane research. As the regulating body for magical affairs within the Duchy, it mostly upholds the Wermian Accords but does not enforce any regulations in the Barrens of the Gladewood.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Demographics

  

Overall population figures are less vague in Garmeley than perhaps in other Countries, the likely estimates are around 2.4 million people.

The largest City, Forrington, is populated by almost 44 thousand people, the second largest City, Redflow is populated by a little over  31 thousand people, the Duchies other cities of note in terms of size are Jorrenstead, Tewkford and Thulmouth. 

The last Census in the Duchy determined a further 48 towns within its borders, the remaining population living in numerous small villages or isolated dwellings.

Though not officially part of the Duchy, Reansport houses almost 29 thousand citizens.

  
  

A majority of the country's citizens are human, with cultural Garmians making up by far the largest part of that group, Urians are a distant second with minor Frednan and Hainachi communities present as well.

A sizable dwarfish population lives in the cities of Dolm and Whistlemine, while the majority of Gnomish and Elven Citizen live in Redflow and Jorrenstead.

  
  
  
  
  
  

Religion

  

A majority of the population, including the ruling House of Garmeley and the entirety of the major nobility follows the Kindly Lords of Glade and River, organized by the Leafpriests of Sunminster.

There is a considerable amount of Gethric Faithful, primarily in Jorrenstead and Reansport.

Gnomish and Dwarvish Communities in Dolm and Redflow partially worship various deities of the old faith in the Gods of Forge and Fire.

  

While the Gods of Forge and Fire are often seen with respect and almost related to the dominant belief in the Kindly Lords, many Gethric communities within the Duchy are treated far worse and are largely tolerated due to a need to keep up good relations with neighbouring countries, particularly the Holy Kingdom itself.

  

Elven minorities upholding their Faith in the Paragons of the Elbae are tolerated, even though much rarer than the two aforementioned religious minorities.
