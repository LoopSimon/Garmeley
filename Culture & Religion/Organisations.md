**A list of internationally important Organizations of the World:

  

Kherovan Inquisition

Founded in the Year 829PA, following the defeat of the vile Arcanist Ahrmiz ni-Kulu, more commonly known as Ahrmiz the Conjurer, this institution is under the direct control of the Patriarch of Kher as the head of the Kherovan-Gethric denomination.

The Inquisition bemoans the Wermian Accords as the main agreement to regulate Magic, as it is in their words “a near 400 year old document that could not fathom the cruel ingenuity to come”, and is officially tasked with enforcing Magical Law within Kher itself.

However due to the good relationship with Vihr and Grevenna that Kher keeps, as well as their economic power as the main trade route to Nirydia, Kherovan Inquisitors often operate outside of their country, and can even hold royal mandates allowing the pursuit and handling of any Fugitive, Criminal or Threat to Kher and her people.

In reality most stories around Kher Inquisitors or “Witchfinders” as they are known outside the eastern country are not nearly as negative as one would believe, while stories of them ripping away children from parents or burning citizens on a pyre exist, they are usually paired with reports of the Inquisitors genuinely helping commonfolk, detaining and hunting down aberrations or pacifying rogue and criminal casters.

The Seat of the Inquisition is the Capital city of Kher, at the Silent Monastery; 

It is said that deep within its halls the most committed members of the Inquisition sacrifice the purity of the soul to embrace magic themselves for the use of the Inquisition and Church.

  

Gethric Clergy of Iztaw

Representing the oldest denomination of Gethricism, the Clerics and Priests of Iztaw are present in Chapels and Churches around the modern world.

What differentiates them from Clerics following Neo-Gethricism besides their actual teachings, is their organization as the Iztaw Clergy follows a strict hierarchy of Priests, Clerics and Bishops that all report and answer to the office of the High-Bishop of Iztaw itself.

The vast funds and incredible influence on their worshippers have often led to this Institution of Faith to be seen as barely less than a Nation of its own, for many decades of history it was true that the High-Bishop was the most powerful man in Vihr, not the King in Zavlech.

It is said that Agents of the Church take on forms and guises of all shapes and colours, and work from the light of the altar as much as from the shadows of an alleyway, but beyond anything else the Clergy values discretion and therefore their methods or involvement is 

usually left to speculations.

  

Korsfall College

The Korsfall College of Astronomy and Magicks is the largest place of academic research and education into Arcane and Divine Magic, and home to the great Wulfrick-Observatory.

Applicants into higher courses are carefully observed and any talented caster, as well as any and all trueborn applicant is put under binding treaties of arcane nature that can force the recipient to submit to the holder.

Despite these somewhat harsh practices, the College is an Institution of great renown and respect far beyond the borders of Meadrath, Alumni are sometimes sent to the courts of nobility in advisory positions, primarily in the lands of Battvia, Garmeley, Hainach, Urland.

Institutions closely related and in cooperation with the Korsfall College include Patwin Tower in Garmeley, the Royal Academy of Battvia and the Excavators Guild in Butera.

  
  

Vrieman Bank of Uhl

The largest Bank in the known world and the center of currency regulation, is the Vrieman Bank whose Headquarters are within the walls of the Free City of Uhl.

The Currency regulated and printed in Uhl is known as the Urien Gryphon, and commonly used in its form as the Gold Gryphon, the Silver Gryphon and the Hatchling.

During the aftermath of the War of Horn and Fang, both Meadrath and Vihr agreed to uphold the currency and full autonomy of the City, in exchange for fair trade rights along the Trinmo and Uhl Toll in Urland and the Torn Sea for both.

While on paper such an agreement may have weakened the city itself, in reality it became an extremely safe and lucrative harbour for trade and its identity as the home of the largest financial institution in the world, regulating all currency north of the Sultanate saw Uhl and the Vrieman Bank grow at a rate nobody even dreamed of.

The Bank has offices in most major cities in the known world, including Jiravid although the Urien Gryphon is not common currency in the Sultanat.

  
  
  
  
  
  

Excavators Guild of Butera

Founded at the end of the 6th century in Battvia as a support group and supply center for adventurers looking to venture into the Ruins of Ancient Rakh after the Great Expedition.

Over years the Headquarters of the Guild were officially established on the island-city of Butera and grew into an academic institution, responsible for almost all ventures deep within the Wastes and beyond.

The Modern day guild oversees protection for archeological ventures and any caravans looking to venture into Rakh and has slowly merged with the Silver Company, a Mercenary Band established by former adventurers in the 7th century.  
Controlling all major entryways, and essentially most resources in terms of navigation and travel has given the Guild a monopoly on Rakhian excavations, specifically archeological sites they protect and control. 

Due to the major demand for elder artifacts by Academic Institutions like Korsfall College, the Guild has enjoyed financial prosperity for the majority of the last 3 centuries and now basically controls the island of Butera, being a major factor to the outcome of the Battvian Civil war.

In modern times the Buterans have launched multiple expeditions into southern Itharia, yet to public knowledge without any success whatsoever, while also keeping a stern eye on their control over the Rakhian Wasteland, to the dismay and ire of countries like Hainach or Garmeley. 

  
  
  
  
  
  

The Ottian Syndicate

The Art of Artificery describes the three Schools of magical research related to Artifacts, Maintenance, Modulation and Creation, and nobody can deny the gnomes of Ott their superiority in this field.

While Maintenance is common enough knowledge to be found elsewhere, Modulation is a much more complex subject to tackle and Creation is a school so occult it is basically only taught and practiced to a large extent within the Twin City itself. 

A Graduate of the Ottian Schools receives a mark of trade and is offered membership in the syndicate, should they choose to leave the Twin City behind which many do, joining the court of a noble lord or setting up shop in a lucrative location to offer their service for coin.

The Syndicate as an Institution offers its members safe communication and access to research and resources, while its treaties with many cities and governments benefit its members as well.

Politically the Syndicate of Ott has long been at odds with the Buteran Excavators guild, who see the creation of artifacts as a massive threat to their business based on the excavation of rakhian resources to the same ends, as the Syndicate is a more or less official branch of the Ottian Government and thereby closely tied to the Kingdom of Meadrath however, any actual conflict between the two organisations usually occurs in backrooms, offices or in the wilderness.

  

The Order of the Silver Wheel

A paramilitary organisation founded by Gethric monks in 398PA looking to protect the pilgrimage to Iztaw throughout lost Wermia.

During the early days of Gethricism, these warrior monks would guard the roads from Urland to Iztaw, its Paladins wearing mighty silver wheels to smite any and all demonic aberration that may linger and lurk in the Desolation of Wermia. 

Although the Order operates independent from the Vihr Throne in Zachlew, it is sponsored and likely tied with the High Bishopric of Iztaw itself and has in ages past raised their banner in support of political wars, like the Wars of Elbae Agression, where they fought on the side of the Gethric Alliance. 

Ahead of the Schism of 764, the Order attempted to interfere and forcibly dissolve the Conclave at Trinfurt, and was challenged by local heroes and armed forces of the Meadi King in armed conflict, their failure and the inevitable Split of the Faith have left the Order with much less influence on the world stage in the modern age.

Although their holy mandate is still the protection of the Pilgrims Path through Wermia, many Scions of the Silver Wheel roam the lands of the Ilrakhani and Vihir Subcontinents on the search for demons and heretics, often coming in conflict with local authorities and magistrates in doing so.

Racial prejudice and radical Gethricism are still ever present within the order to this day, and many doubt their self described holy and good motives, seeing them as little more than a band of roaming strongmen that seeks ways to rebuild their lost power and glory.

  
  
  
  
  
  

Karajal School of Insight

Named after the Great Mage Karajal of Alparaz (304PA-581PA), this Institution represents not only the modern nexus of magical research, but also is a symbol of the historical dominance the Beheran Elves have held in the higher Sciences of Mathematics, Magic and Astronomy.

Indeed, Karajal as an Academic is one of the greatest in a line of greats, a scholar that can trace back his influences to the beginning of the Sultanat under his mentor, Kwarzimi of Corbaik who himself is known as the Father of elven spellcraft and the Leypoint Model. 

Kwarzimi rejected the established Rakhian models of Conflux-dependency as declared by Phiodales of Mizk, an author and mage in the latter days of ancient Rakh.

The greatest minds, usually but not exclusively elven, of the Continent gather in the Grey Tower of Alparaz, the highest spire of the School, and delve deep into the knowledge of their forbearers.

Indeed so revered and respected is this house of learning, that it largely remains untouched by the political influence of the Sultan and has even openly voiced dissonance with decisions of the Palace in Jiravid without any official reprimand.

The School has stood in relatively close contact with the researchers at Patwin Towers in Garmeley even when the Duchy fought the Sultanate during the Wars of Aggression.

It is said that the wearers of the Star of Karajal, the mark of graduates of all disciplines, is seen by many nobles and academics as a sign of great renown that could open many a door, and is sought after with even more desire than similar status symbols by the Korsfall or Ottian Academies.**
