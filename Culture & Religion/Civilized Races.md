Human

Numerous and ingenious in their variance, humans are by far the most popular race in Vihr and Ilrakhi, they tend to organize in large communities and hierarchies, flocking to religion, magic and charismatic leaders who can promise salvation in this life or the next.

Humans tend to live up to 80 years naturally, although spells or the mere prolonged exposure to magic are known to extend this while many can also fall under this expectancy due to regional infrastructure and wealth. 

Humany has produced many legends and heroes, founded Faiths and forged arcane wonders, while their greatest strength is adaptability, they also tend to excel less in niche aspects of life, warfare or academia.  
Nevertheless it is precisely in this incredible diversity of thought and body that humanity has found the strength to bend most of the known world to its will.

  

Elf

The Elves of Behera live far longer lives than most mortals, with a common elf being able to see almost 250 common calendar years. Said to have been the first civilization to develop agriculture and erect great cities, the elves put an enormous value on record keeping and history, revering their ancestors as paragons and offering tribute to those who came before.

The vast majority of this species are situated alongside the coasts and bountiful rivers of the Beheran Desert having been unified under the ancient Dynasties and the Sultans of the current Age as a politically almost unified race, yet there are elven communities in the far north east and south of old Jiravid that have sought a life under a different rule, religion and philosophy.

Elves usually appear slender and tall, being easily distinguished from humans by their tall and pointy ears and giant eyes. They stop carrying children at a young age of around 30, which has historically led to various attempts of artificially growing their population through science and magic.

They display a natural affinity to certain aspects of magic, primarily the arcane but are not known to produce an abnormal amount of trueborn mages. 

  

Drow

The Drow, also known as Under-Elves of Dark-Elves, are the extremely closely related cousins of the Elves, their appearance changed from over two millenia of a live underground: Their skin is fair and pale, their eyes usually even larger than those of their surface kin and extremely sensitive to the sunlight.

The Drow are rarely seen above ground, but many serve in the Undercities of the Sultanat where the grand Mausoleums of the Surface reveal their true extent as giant resting places of worship for their fallen Paragons.

  

Half Elf

Classically described as the result of a Union between Elf and Man, dominant human features will usually quickly overtake the more discernible elven heritage.

A relatively large number of Half-Elves exists within the Elbae Sultanate, as well as within the Southern Realms of Battiva, Garmeley and the Paper Cities, although they are rarely seen in bigger numbers in Grevenna or Vihr. 

  
  
  

Orc

Red, Grey, Blue and Green skinned seafarers, masters of sail and wind; 

The humble and gentle Orcs, or “Qa” in their tongue, are of tall stature and imposing builds, they can reach ages of up to 70 years and commonly sprout fierce tusks from their lower jaws.

While most Orcs today can be found in the vicinity of the remnant of Qa, their home is said to lie even further east, across the great ocean in the land of Dawn. 

Due to their origins and common practice as wandering sailors, Orcs are rarely tied down to one place, especially after the Destruction of of the Lands of Qa in what is now known as Il-Haena at the hands of the Sultanat, they take extremly well to different climates and can be found sailing even the icy waters of the torn sea in the far north, where they are valued for their prowess and enjoy rich lifestyles in port cities like Sallesand.

  

The Deepfolk

Dwarf

Small in stature, the bearded and sturdy dwarves are masterful stone and metal workers that live in deep cavern cities and mountain holds.

The greatest Dwarven Cities are built in exhausted volcanos where they believe their gods of forge and fire fought in older days.

Unlike their surface loving cousins, the dwarves of the world are less interested in the worldly affairs of war and politics, preferring to tend their ancient halls and worship through craftsmanship. They can generally live for up to 150 years and reach a height of at most 5 ft or 150 centimetres; their eyes are adapted to darkness and can see detail and far in dim light but struggle a little to make out details at range when in the sunlight of the surfaceworld.

Gnome

The Cousins and close relatives of Dwarves, Gnomefolk dislike the underground and prefer to live under the sun and moon of the world instead.  
As opposed to their dwarvish relatives, they can barely grow a beard and are even smaller at an average 4ft. While reaching the same lifespan of about 150 years.

Outside of the City of Ott, there are almost no larger settlements of just gnomes, who instead prefer to found families in the communities of elves and humans, often seen in Gnomish Ghettos in the larger Metropolis of the world.

It is said that while they are mostly spreading their knowledge through the commercial enterprise of Institutions like the Ott Syndicate, the Gnomish Theoretical Metaphysicists and Arcanists are the most learned Researchers in the Realm of Magical Theory, especially when it comes to applied Artificery, the study of Maintenance, Manipulation and Creation of Magical Objects and Artifacts.

This deep understanding of such a useful aspect of the weave of the world, coupled with their politically speaking humble nature, has given the Gnomes a great reputation in almost every corner of the world.

  
  
  
  
  

The Goblinoids

Goblin

Goblins are of small stature but great minds and a strong survival instinct, these dwellers of the underground are perhaps the only race in the world who has adapted to life in the darkness of the Underworld more than the Mountain loving Dwarves.

They tend to stand at around 3-5ft tall and can live for up to 120 years, extremely nimble and adaptable climbers, they can see without any issues in pitchblack darkness , as long as it's not of the magical kind.

Usually varying between black, grey, blue or green skin, the Gobins are extremely distant cousins of the warlike Hobgoblin Tribes of the Surface, a relation the communal and industrious goblins would rather leave behind and that has brought them much trouble and bad reputation in the past.

Some think the underground cities of the Goblins, like the mythical Hive City of Pintrixaz, account for so many of them that they easily outnumber even the ever growing number of humans on the surface, but in the light of the sun only a few goblins travel.

Usually these Surface dwelling Goblins roam the lands in tight-knit communities, travelling from city to city and eventually returning to a cavern entrance of the Underworld tunnels every few decades.

Their acceptance in the Communities of Elves, Humans and Gnomes varies greatly, depending on what the level of education and past experiences of the regions have been, although the wandering merchants are generally never accepted from entering city walls.In reality, most goblins are sociable, friendly and very communal, accepting of outsiders and giving people that have been burned often by lies and propaganda, generally due to their relation to the destructive and belligerent hobgoblins.
