Goblin

Goblins are of small stature but great minds and a strong survival instinct, these dwellers of the underground are perhaps the only race in the world who has adapted to life in the darkness of the Underworld more than the Mountain loving Dwarves.

They tend to stand at around 3-5ft tall and can live for up to 120 years, extremely nimble and adaptable climbers, they can see without any issues in pitchblack darkness , as long as it's not of the magical kind.

Usually varying between black, grey, blue or green skin, the Gobins are extremely distant cousins of the warlike Hobgoblin Tribes of the Surface, a relation the communal and industrious goblins would rather leave behind and that has brought them much trouble and bad reputation in the past.

Some think the underground cities of the Goblins, like the mythical Hive City of Pintrixaz, account for so many of them that they easily outnumber even the ever growing number of humans on the surface, but in the light of the sun only a few goblins travel.

Usually these Surface dwelling Goblins roam the lands in tight-knit communities, travelling from city to city and eventually returning to a cavern entrance of the Underworld tunnels every few decades.

Their acceptance in the Communities of Elves, Humans and Gnomes varies greatly, depending on what the level of education and past experiences of the regions have been, although the wandering merchants are generally never accepted from entering city walls.In reality, most goblins are sociable, friendly and very communal, accepting of outsiders and giving people that have been burned often by lies and propaganda, generally due to their relation to the destructive and belligerent hobgoblins.
