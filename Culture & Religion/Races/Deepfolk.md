Dwarf

Small in stature, the bearded and sturdy dwarves are masterful stone and metal workers that live in deep cavern cities and mountain holds.

The greatest Dwarven Cities are built in exhausted volcanos where they believe their gods of forge and fire fought in older days.

Unlike their surface loving cousins, the dwarves of the world are less interested in the worldly affairs of war and politics, preferring to tend their ancient halls and worship through craftsmanship. They can generally live for up to 150 years and reach a height of at most 5 ft or 150 centimetres; their eyes are adapted to darkness and can see detail and far in dim light but struggle a little to make out details at range when in the sunlight of the surfaceworld.

Gnome

The Cousins and close relatives of Dwarves, Gnomefolk dislike the underground and prefer to live under the sun and moon of the world instead.  
As opposed to their dwarvish relatives, they can barely grow a beard and are even smaller at an average 4ft. While reaching the same lifespan of about 150 years.

Outside of the City of Ott, there are almost no larger settlements of just gnomes, who instead prefer to found families in the communities of elves and humans, often seen in Gnomish Ghettos in the larger Metropolis of the world.

It is said that while they are mostly spreading their knowledge through the commercial enterprise of Institutions like the Ott Syndicate, the Gnomish Theoretical Metaphysicists and Arcanists are the most learned Researchers in the Realm of Magical Theory, especially when it comes to applied Artificery, the study of Maintenance, Manipulation and Creation of Magical Objects and Artifacts.

This deep understanding of such a useful aspect of the weave of the world, coupled with their politically speaking humble nature, has given the Gnomes a great reputation in almost every corner of the world.
