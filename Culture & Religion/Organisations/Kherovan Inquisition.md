[[Kherova]] [[Gethricism]]
Founded in the Year 829PA, following the defeat of the vile Arcanist Ahrmiz ni-Kulu, more commonly known as Ahrmiz the Conjurer, this institution is under the direct control of the Patriarch of Kher as the head of the Kherovan-Gethric denomination.

The Inquisition bemoans the Wermian Accords as the main agreement to regulate Magic, as it is in their words “a near 400 year old document that could not fathom the cruel ingenuity to come”, and is officially tasked with enforcing Magical Law within Kher itself.

However due to the good relationship with Vihr and Grevenna that Kher keeps, as well as their economic power as the main trade route to Nirydia, Kherovan Inquisitors often operate outside of their country, and can even hold royal mandates allowing the pursuit and handling of any Fugitive, Criminal or Threat to Kher and her people.

In reality most stories around Kher Inquisitors or “Witchfinders” as they are known outside the eastern country are not nearly as negative as one would believe, while stories of them ripping away children from parents or burning citizens on a pyre exist, they are usually paired with reports of the Inquisitors genuinely helping commonfolk, detaining and hunting down aberrations or pacifying rogue and criminal casters.

The Seat of the Inquisition is the Capital city of Kher, at the Silent Monastery; 

It is said that deep within its halls the most committed members of the Inquisition sacrifice the purity of the soul to embrace magic themselves for the use of the Inquisition and Church.
