[[Gethricism]] [[Wermia]]
A paramilitary organisation founded by Gethric monks in 398PA looking to protect the pilgrimage to Iztaw throughout lost Wermia.

During the early days of Gethricism, these warrior monks would guard the roads from Urland to Iztaw, its Paladins wearing mighty silver wheels to smite any and all demonic aberration that may linger and lurk in the Desolation of Wermia. 

Although the Order operates independent from the Vihr Throne in Zachlew, it is sponsored and likely tied with the High Bishopric of Iztaw itself and has in ages past raised their banner in support of political wars, like the Wars of Elbae Agression, where they fought on the side of the Gethric Alliance. 

Ahead of the Schism of 764, the Order attempted to interfere and forcibly dissolve the Conclave at Trinfurt, and was challenged by local heroes and armed forces of the Meadi King in armed conflict, their failure and the inevitable Split of the Faith have left the Order with much less influence on the world stage in the modern age.

Although their holy mandate is still the protection of the Pilgrims Path through Wermia, many Scions of the Silver Wheel roam the lands of the Ilrakhani and Vihir Subcontinents on the search for demons and heretics, often coming in conflict with local authorities and magistrates in doing so.

Racial prejudice and radical Gethricism are still ever present within the order to this day, and many doubt their self described holy and good motives, seeing them as little more than a band of roaming strongmen that seeks ways to rebuild their lost power and glory.
