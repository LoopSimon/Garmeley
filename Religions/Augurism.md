Augurism is a philosophical and religious practice rooted in the teachings of Augur Ralfantis, a syncretic figure combining elements of the [[Greater Spirit]] Trin and the [[Turvik Paganism]] Deathgod Heagur.
Augurism encompasses a wide range of occultist knowledge, including alchemy astrology, and primarily focuses on the marriage of the arcane and divine.
The writings attributed to Ralfantis were produced over many centuries by the Auguri Sages, a group of authors that existed during the 2nd century BA.

As a living tradition it is still practiced in the Mead Region as the formers lands of the[[Auguri Dominion]] , specifically parts of northern and western [[Meadrath]] and within [[Cimfon]].


The Gin-Augur

The Cult of Gin-Augur follows the belief in a future saviour and reincarnation of Augur Ralfantis, that shall be born from the midst of his worshipers.
This "second birth" is described as an Ascendence through self-actualization in strength, some figures have claimed to have reached this state in the past and it is usually associated with worldly power.
Thus do Cultists often attempt to reach might over their fellow man, be it physical power, magical prowess or social influence.

The Cult in any larger form is only active in the isolated country of Cimfon, where it is most commonly associated with ritual cannibalism.
