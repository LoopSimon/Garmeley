Augurism is a philosophical and religious practice rooted in the teachings of Augur Ralfantis, a syncretic figure combining elements of the Riverspirit Trin and the Turvik Deathgod Heagur.
Augurism encompasses a wide range of occultist knowledge, including alchemy astrology, and primarily focuses on the marriage of the arcane and divine.
The writings attributed to Ralfantis were produced over many centuries by the Auguri Sages, a group of authors that existed during the 2nd century BA.
