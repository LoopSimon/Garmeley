Kherovian Gethricism / Khethricism

  

The Patriarch of Kher does not formally bow to the Great Bishop at Iztaw and this denomination is almost entirely regional within the Khatrym of [[Kherova]] and the Principality of [[Azuvke]].
A country of men and dwarf alike, naturalistic spirit worship quickly made way to the fast spread of the Gethric Faith, ,the deeply ingrained cultural hatred of the kherovans for arcane magic quickly latched on to the Demon slaying Gethric, known as Kethric in the Khatrym, for was it not Wermian Arcanists who summoned these terrible creatures in their grand Rubric?

This hatred for magic, as well as a deep respect for Craftsmanship and the Arts that came from hundreds of years of dwarvish-human coexistence show us the focus of Kethricism as the Kherovian Patriarchat and School of Faith is colloquially known as.
Vows here often include concrete goals and are usually internal;  
It is seen as a taboo or extreme rarity that one would reveal one's inner convictions, as a Vihrian may do proudly.


Khethricism acknowledges most [[Gethric Saints]], with the exception of Tronos and Markur.
The Patron saint of Kherova is Vazena of Kairos, although Ralond the Scaleslayer is arguably of greater popularity due to his status as a mythical hero in pre Gethic Folklore.
