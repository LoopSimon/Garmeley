The dominant Faith in Ilrakhan, Gethricist Practice is founded on the writings of Gethric's Companions, the Church fathers, of whom some are revered as Saints. It is split into three major denominations, Gethricism, also known as High-Gethricism, [[Kethricism]] and [[Trinicism]].
Important Holidays include the Silver Procession, a week of celebrations held in the first month of the year and the Day of the Prophet, which is celebrated at the end of Summer.

### Central Belief

Gethricism promises self-fulfilment and realization in power and wisdom, through hard work, and honesty with oneself and one's environment.

With true and righteous convictions, said without deceit and lie, a mouse could move a mountain and change the very fabric of the world itself, and weave a thread so strong in the world that it may yet endure death itself and retain Ego and Memory in the afterlife, joining Gethric and those faithful in the Homestead Beyond, a paradise without suffering or trial.

Core to the Gethric worldview, is that while the physical remains of a corpse wither away or could even be reanimated or defiled with foul necromancy, the spirit separates from the body upon true death usually losing itself and all individualism in the process.

The Oaths and Tenants itself are almost always more important than their content to a devout Gethric believer; as long as they are said and upheld with conviction before oneself, they act like a guiding path and warding light on the road until the afterlife.

A Central theme of Gethricism is also the rejection of other creator deities or all-powerful gods, instead they rejoice in the worship of the figures in history believed to have led truly holy and principled lives, the Prophets, who they believe to reside as immortal sages in the Homestead Beyond.

Major Values encouraged to uphold are natural order and hierarchy, as the King rules the Peasant, so does the Father the Son, and the Fox the Hare; progressive and revolutionary ideas are often rejected or looked upon warily by traditional Gethrists. A strong sense of order and lawful customs, and a deep respect for both family, ancestor and the dead are taught within the Abbeys and Chapels of the Church, who itself officially canonises [[Gethric Saints]] and Blessed peoples with utmost care.
### Origin of the Faith

It was in 240 PA, that Gethric of Iztaw slew the Daemon Lord Koribael, head of the Ashen Legions and ended the Wermian Incursions.

Originally born a commoner, Gethric displayed incredible fervour in his fight against the Demonic tide, founding a Group of Warrior Monks that would work great wonders and miracles in the Incursions. The fateful battle with Koribael devastated a large area of land around the capital of Wern and ended in a disruption of white fire, as eyewitnesses and later on fathers of the church tell it, which took both the mortal as well as the Fiend into the lands beyond.

Those closest friends and followers of Gethric that remained quickly spread word of his deed and continued to heal the lands as best they could; teaching nobles and commoners alike the mantras and oaths of Gethrics Brotherhood so they may too work miracles thought impossible.

Volboris the Healer, oldest friend of the late hero then proclaimed 1 year after Gethric's passing that his church would be born in the very city he first saw daylight in, holy Iztaw.

Over the following decades and centuries, Gethricism spread like wildfire throughout the Lands of modern day Vihr, Grachy, Kherova, Grevenna, Urland, Meadrath, Battvia and beyond.

The White Book, a collection of quotes, saying, prayers and oaths by the earliest Church-Fathers, as compiled by the Saint Rodymir of Voblag, is a symbol of the academic aspect of the Faith, as many hermits, priests, clerics and bishops have devoted themselves solely to the study of self-enlightenment through Gethricism.

### High Gethricism and its denominations

The oldest and still most widespread form of Gethricism, puts additional value into the literal transcriptions of the Prophets and his Brotherhoods words, often taking literal and perhaps somewhat outdated meanings from them.

At its head sits the Gethric Clergy of Iztaw, representing the oldest denomination of Gethricism, the Clerics and Priests of Iztaw are present in Chapels and Churches around the modern world.

The vast funds and incredible influence on their worshippers have often led to this Institution of Faith to be seen as barely less than a Nation of its own, for many decades of history it was true that the High-Bishop was the most powerful man in Vihr, not the King in Zavlech.

Knightly and Monastic Traditions are also deeply ingrained within the Church, often seen within the Hedgeknights that swear oaths to defend those in need and vanquish those who would prey upon them, and then travel the roads and towns of Counties and Kingdoms in the hope to earn their place in the Homestead Beyond.

Vows are usually celebrated as lifelong commitments and sometimes even written down and worn as signs of Fervour and Belief.

The Great Schism, also known as the Gethric Schism, occurred as a result of the Conclave of Trinfurt in 764PA, resulting in many of the western churches less dependant on Iztaw to reorganise in a decentralised denomination, widely referred to as [[Trinicism]], named after Trinfurt itself.

The Kherovan declaration of 471PA, sometimes referred to as the Kherovan Schism, was much less divisive and caused almost no rift within the greater Gethric community of the time and today, as Kheri practices and customs were already very different and foreign to the Vihri Gethric Tradition.
The Kherovan denomination is often referred to as [[Kethricism]], and the Prophet Gethric as Kethric.


### Liturgy

Among the great number of churches numerous liturgical rites exists which reflect the regional and historical variety within the Gethric Faith.
The principal Gethric Mass, also known as the the Divine Mass, is the principle Liturgy of the Gethric Church, the kethric Patriarchate has its own rites, while liturgy in the western Trinicist churches vary greatly.

Statues are widespread among all denominations, although most prominently venerated in Kherova.
