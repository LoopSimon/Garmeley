Originated from the practice of Pehki Druidism and Giantrul traditions, the Aeldcult is a naturalistic Faith that can be related to other forms of Spirit worship such as the worship of the [[Kindly Lords]] or the [[Gods of Forge and Fire]].
However where these practices worship specific deities, the Aeldcult believes in a greater consciousness of the land itself and views the Fey of the Eldveil as almost divine beings and messengers of the land itself.
The Eldveil, a stretch of dense Forest between Ukiolla and the Waekajokull, is seen as a holy place of worship within the Aeldcult. It is still common practice to send elders ready for death out into the veil as well as bury the fallen there.
