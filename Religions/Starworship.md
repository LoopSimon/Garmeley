Star worship, sometimes referred to as Astral Cultism, is the veneration of stars by the faithful of the [[Jahul Cyclor]].

The observation and veneration of celestial bodies likely always played a larger role in the ancient cyraclian culture, even before the development of a dominant theology within the Jahul, long after the Fall of Cyraclion.

The Star [[Malham]] is worshipped as the the Deity Xanring and associated with cosmic order, governance and viewed as a symbol of earthly power and hierarchical power.

The Star [[Urden]] is worshipped as the Deity Shoyal and associated with the elements and magic.

The ability to align the celestial forces of Malham and Urden is seen as essential to the legitimacy of the First Seer.
