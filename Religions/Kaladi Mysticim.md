The Kaladi are divine spirits that were once mortal and deified after death, usually heroes and leaders of the [[Gnoll]]ish people. They are honoured in festivals and associated with certain types of rhythms and sounds.
Often Kaladi are associated with geographic locations, like mountains, rivers or cities notably not as personifications of nature, like within the Faith of the [[Kindly Lords]] for examples, but as patrons and patronesses.

Popular Kaladi include:

1. Barxu, 
	the kaladi associated with sexuality, fertiliy, water and love. 
	She is the patron Kaladi of the river Barxonses River along wich the majority of Gnolls live in the modern age. 
	It is said Barxu was a wise shaman in her life that led her people to the rich riverlands west of the Kneebreaker mountains.

2. Jibey
	the kaladi associated with order, divine rule and power.
	He is the patron Kaladi of Mount Jibey, the tallest peak of the Kneebreaker mountain range.
	Jibey was a famous Chieftain of the Gnollish tribes that achieved a great victory against the Pravazik Empire in the 4th century PA.
