Though drawing on ancient [[Palmunia|Palmunian]] religion, the religion of the Rakhians retains noticeable elements of reconstructed [[Turvik Paganism]] as well, as theorised by Meynar of Jorrenstead (ca. 819PA) in his "Historiae Uriorum".
For example, Kolohoz the Old Guide and his travels along the roads beyond in the Rakhian mythos resemble the tasks and the description of Heagur in Turvik mythology, although it is unclear which tradition may have influenced the other, if at all.

The liminal figure mediating between the intimately connected worlds of gods and mankind within Rakhian belief was the Emperor and Priest, in a ritual described on Rakhian tables it is described that Izmarid, the Great Serpent of Change has entrusted to the Emperor the land and his household so that he may protect it in Izmarids stead.
The Rakhians did not perform regularly scheduled ceremonies to appease the gods, but instead conducted rituals in answer to hard times or to mark occasions, myth and ritual were closely related, as many rituals were based on myth, and often involved performing the stories themselves in a religious performance.

The most important Gods within Rakhian Mythology were:

Izmarid the Great Serpent of Chaos, described as a red-scaled, winged Serpent with a wolfs head.
He was closely associate with fire and catastrophe but also life and victory in war.

The Wind god Kirnek, depicted as a Man with the upper body of an eagle, his worship seems to have been closely associated with seafaring traditions and the weather.

Kolohoz the Old Guide, a Psychopomp figure as mentioned above, was described as a severely overweight and senile naked man that moved upon a flying platform of stone.

Chimar the Sun Hunter, is theorised to be a representation of the later Emperor of Rakh and is seen as an amalgamation of the rulers of the great Empire, depicted as an armoured warrior with burning eyes.
