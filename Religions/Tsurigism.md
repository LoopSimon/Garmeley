The philosophical and religious practice of the Mogyri people of east Nirydia.
Tsurugism is deeply connected with the Mogyri practice of Shroom-bonding and can be roughly divided into two major schools of thoughts:

## Lhatsurgic Faith

Named after the Prophet Lhatsi, adherents to this school of Tsurigism believe in the existence of a "Greater Will" who's vision and influence is communicated with the Mogyri through frequent use.
Lhatsurgic Doctrine frequently values the Fungi over its carrier.
Followers of Lhatsi tend to organize more in settled and hierarchical communities.

## Ancient Tsurigism

Still practiced by a large minority of Mogyri, the elder practices of Tsurigist thought are alive in the less civilized corners of the Drizan Peninsula, predating Lhatsi and her teachings.
The core ideal of most variants of ancient tsurigist practice concern the journey of one and ones shroom through life and seek to achieve enlightenment through spiritual and physical osmosis.
