Introduction:

Traditional spiritual practices and beliefs of Garmian and Reani people are based on a type of animism, polytheism and what modern gethric scholars may consider shamanism due to early practices.

In essence the faith describes the practice of the Garmian and Reani Cultures, to seek out, 
worship and commune with power entities of the [[Spiritual Realm]], that manifest themselves as representations of the Environment.

Today the specific cults of the so called Kindly Lords, are only worshipped to a large scale in the Duchy of [[Garmeley]] , the Princedom of [[Hainach]] and in the major cities surrounding these realms, such as the formally independent Republic of [[Reanport]], although the Kindly Lords are not persecuted against in the Urien Lands, major differences and conflicts within [[Eldmar]] and  [[Trinvale]] have arisen from the fact that large minorities in these regions actively reject [[Gethricism]] in favour of the Kindly Lords.

The religious traditions associated with the Kindly Lords and more generic Spirit Worship can vary considerably from region to region in Inara, but the Faith in the Kindly Lords specifically describes the practice of worshipping naturalistic spirits as individual deities, notably different from classical Pantheon worship such as the [[Rakhian Mythology]] or the [[Yari Faith]] in the sense that the Kindly Lords physically manifested entities within the world that become objects of worship, rather than the other way around.
While the specific deities worshipped vary by region and over time, underlying this are broad similarities in both deities and a basic religious homogeneity among Garmian, Reani and Urien peoples.
Although due to the nature of the religion, there are almost no widely worshipped Spirits outside of their local domains.

### Historical Worship and Druidic tradition:

Druids, were priests of ancient worship of the Kindly Lords, in a time where worldly leaders and communities were structured around religious anointment and protection, due to the close relationship of mortals and [[Fey]], specifically within the region of Garmeley and the Greenglade Forest.
Garmian and Reani druids held ceremonies in sacred groves and other natural shrines, or even ritual enclosures, these ancient druidic circles and tribal communities often made votive offerings which would be deposited in the local domain of a spirit, such as water or wetlands, or in ritualistic shafts.
There is well documented evidence that ancient Garmian and Reani peoples sacrificed livestock and even people, usually slaves, most commonly in ritualistic burnings.

### Modern day Worship:

The evolution of the Druidic worship of powerful natural spirits into regional and local cults was a gradual one, but can largely be attributed to the emergency of Feudalism and a shift in the way the population was distributed, specifically in Garmeley, old traditions such as the ceremonial marriage of the Riverking of Garm to a Daughter of the Feywild of Greenglade fading away due to political developments have led to a gradual distance between the physical realms more preformative worship and the spiritual realms reception and reaction to it.

Whereas once deities such as the Farrman would often physically commune with Priests and Druids, events such as these are exceedingly rare.
The last time a spirit has actively interfered in an event was when the Karolian, a spirit of the Burrows, was seen in active conflict with the rogue Mage Jonek Two-Tongues.
