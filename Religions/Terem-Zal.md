<p>The Cult of the Stone, The gods of Forge and Fire, the Terem-Zal: there are many names for the deities worshipped by the many sects of Gnomes and Dwarves across the Inaran Underlands, all practicing secrecy and isolationism. Few outsiders know the truth about the Mountain Gods: far from just being spiritual concepts, they inhabit mighyt physical forms guarded deep within the earth, around which the largest of the Dwarven Holds were build in time immermorial, their bodies taking the form of great spheres, formed by unknown substances somewhere between rock and crystal. </p>
<h2>Priesthood of the Terem-Zal</h2>
<p>Zal The Priets of the Terem-Zal are made up of a variety of orders and guardians within the broader community of the Dwarven and Gnomish Faith, holding different positions and roles of worldly authority depending on local culture and tradition. Typically organized within a Hold under a singular High-Priest, they are often the primary connective tissue between different dwarven holds and gnomish communities, that would otherwise remain largely isolated. The practice of the Algarak, the Path of the Ancestors, describes the task to visit the many holy sites and temples of the Terem-Zal scattered around the Underlands and is overseen by the Priesthood. These Priests tend to stay small in numbers, for the secrets and insights they guard are of extreme importance to not only the culture and history of their local community, but the past present and future of the entire Deepfolk. They venture only rarely outside of their holy sites, if so often on important tasks ordained either by their High-Priest or as political envoys for their hold, although this can vary greatly depending on the local cult.</p>

<h2>The Runestones of the Terem-Zal</h2>
<p>The vast majority of the faithful worshippers of the Gods of Stone is not permitted to lay their eyes or dare touch the phyiscal forms of their deities: however certain Cults have permitted holy artifacts to be formed, largely unknown in their origin, that allow a connection to its respective god. Often granted to an individual Guardian within the priesthood, these artifacts can vary in use, power and purpose but generally act as a connective tissue between the faithful populace and their Mountain Gods.</p>
