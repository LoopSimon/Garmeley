The Practice of Paragonworship describes the mummification and preservation of ancient elves within the Beheran Tomb Cities.
Legendary Rulers and heroes have undergone this process and receive worship but extremely rarely such a Paragon has undergone a process called "Awakening".
In such a case, historically only in the case of those Paragons who were capable of powerful magic in life, a Paragon is transformed into a powerful unliving Magical Artifact that acts as a Permanent Fluxbridge, as far as modern [[Basic Magical Theory]] is concerned.

The last known Awakening occured in 321PA after the Death and Paragonhood of  Irimaa Anhur.

Shortly after, in 329PA, the current Sultan Lizun Elbae declared only those of royal blood would be allowed entry as Paragons within the Tomb Cities henceforth in what is now known as the Doctrine of  Elbae Exceptionalism.
