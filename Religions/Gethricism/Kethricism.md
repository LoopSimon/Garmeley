Kherovian Gethricism / Khethricism

  

The Patriarch of Kher does not formally bow to the Great Bishop at Iztaw and this denomination is almost entirely regional within the Khatrym of [[Kherova]].

A country of men and dwarf alike, naturalistic spirit worship quickly made way to the fast spread of the Gethric Faith, ,the deeply ingrained cultural hatred of the kherovans for arcane magic quickly latched on to the Demon slaying Gethric, for was it not Wermian Arcanists who summoned these terrible creatures in their grand Rubric?

This hatred for magic, as well as a deep respect for Craftsmanship and the Arts that came from hundreds of years of dwarvish-human coexistence show us the focus of Kethricism as the Kherovian Patriarchat and School of Faith is colloquially known as.

Vows here often include concrete goals and are usually internal;  
It is seen as a taboo or extreme rarity that one would reveal one's inner convictions, as a Vihrian may do proudly.
