Trinnic Gethricism / Trinicism

  

The newest and least organized denomination was founded  following the Conclave at Trinfurt and the Gethric Schism in 764PA.  
Largely a response of Western Bishops in Battvia and Meadrath to the extreme authority and control of the Iztaw Clergy and the start of its anti-elven Pogroms, it acted as a valve for the emerging western realms to take control away from what they perceived to be a Vihrian state-controlled entity and allow the citizens of their own countries to attempt to achieve the afterlife in their own way.

With only regional Authorities and a much more progressive outlook, Trinicism may have produced less miracle workers and divine leaders, but if often heralded as a Faith for truly everyone, that celebrates merit and equality over right of birth.

Vows here often include attempts at change and reflection of one or one's environment, ambitions and dreams.
