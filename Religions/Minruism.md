Primarily practiced within the woods of Rogyn and its elvish inhabitants, Minruism is a philosophy more so than a religion. Its adherents believe in the immortality of the soul through reincarnation and practice ritualistic seeking ceremonies that declare reborn believers in new-borns.
Names are holy to Minruists and the "Book of Souls" holds the names of almost all known Rogyn-born elves in it, the naming of a new-born is forbidden until it can be determined who had been its previous incarnation, at which point the baby receives the name it had previously held; a consequence of this tradition is the strict regulation of multiple names, having the same name to another is seen as special and can be looked down upon, depending on the community, or seen as a sign of  ordained partnership.
