A monotheistic Faith that believes in the god Lakal and divine symmetry, it is the state religion of the [[Twintail Empire]] of central Nirydia.

Lakalism honours symmetry and consonance within nature and culture, as expressed within their four aspects of Lakal: holy symbols that represent the forces through which their god works his wonders on the realm of mortals.
Mathematics is a holy calling for many of the faith, and divine symbols can often express themselves as geometrical shapes or fractals.

The Practice of worshipping anatomical symmetry is commonplace within the faith, mutations such as the name-giving twinned tail of the Royal Line are seen as holy omens, while the mutilation of one half of the body to create dissonance is seen as a punishment often worse than death, examples include the infamous practice of the Emperors of the Twinned-Tail to remove the eyes or ears of their political enemies.
