The Goblins of [[Fogorix]] worship the mysterious Object called the Darksun, a round Stone emanating a purplish light that levitates in the center of Fogorix Cave.
The ruler of the Undercity of Fogorix, Ogana the Eyeless is known as the Darkchild and claims to have been born of the Stone that has granted her mythical powers and immortality.
Other Goblins of the [[Underlands]] dismissively call the Fogori Faithful "Darklings" but they themselves refer to their devout as "Lightkissed" and the Leaders of the Cult as Darkspeakers.

A common theory posits that the Darkspeakers and perhaps even the Darksun itself are of [[Celestial]] Nature.
