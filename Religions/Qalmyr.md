Qalmyr, also known as Orcish Moon Worship, is a dualistic religion centred around the 2 Moons, Qastor, [[The first Moon]] and Zolra, [[The second Moon]].
Its generally mostly [[Orc]]is adherents exalt Qastor as the all-knowing and benevolent god of Property and the supreme being of the Universe, while they fear Zolra as the he cast away to rid himself of all his destructive tendency, evil thoughts and lesser desires.

Qalmyri treat Qastor as the supreme god of the world, but believe in other divine beings known as the Qinari that share some of his traits, these appear as stars and constellations, the Star [[Malham]] for example is known as "the child of destiny" and and associated with hope and innocence. 
In the Teachings of Qalmyr, good fortune comes to those who do righteous deeds for their own sake, not for material reward, while those who commit evil acts align themselves with the foul ways of Zolra and her path of darkness.
The conflict between Qastor and Zolra thus does not take place in any physical manner but in the soul and life of ever Qalmyri.

Qastor, the pale Father
To the Qalmyri, Qastor was once the single universal and transcendental being, the sum of all good and evil in the world both physical and spiritual, arcane and divine.
After the Ikval, the great split between Qastor and Zolra, he remained stripped of his nigh-omnipotent power of creation but also freed of all imperfection and evil.
He is associated with the Summer, clear skies and Warmth, his larger appearance in the skies is not only seen a sign of his greatness but also of his true love for his creation.

Zolra, the ruinous mother
Also known as the great Serpent, Zolra is the antithesis of Qastor, less a sister and more a dark mirror to the creator god, she tempts mortals down a path of ignorance, greed, base desires and egoism. 
The great beasts of the depths are often viewed as the fallen Qinari, the first victims and greatest insult to the greatness of Qastor.
She is associated with Winter, the storm and the cold, he smaller stature in the skies is viewed as a sign for her lesser power and inability to pass Qastors protection.
