The Veilcurse, within the terminology of [[Magical Theory]] vaguely generalizes a phenomenon that occurs to the summoners of planar energies when creating a Fluxbridge, also known as Spellcasters.
It describes the loss of ones own connection to the planar energies of the world when channelling powerful energies without sufficient preparation, resulting in an instant overwhelming of the caster, usually accompanied by mental fracture and physical mutation of the flesh.



When the reign of the infamous Merzigal of Alahmid, better known as the "Great Sculptor", ended in the later half of the 1st century PA, his research into the phenomenon known as the Veilcurse was largely left untouched.
In turn, many years later in the year 587PA, the [[Kherovan Inquisition]] destroyed Alahmid and salted its ruins yet confiscated many tomes and manuscripts regarding the curse that would become the subject of further research.
