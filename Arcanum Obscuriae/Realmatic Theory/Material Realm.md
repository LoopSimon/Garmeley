Introduction:
Within Planar Theory the material Realm represents the physical World, namely the [[Globus]], as well as the [[The first Moon]] and the [[The second Moon]].
It is important to recognize the natural bias of research into realmatic theory when it comes to the differences between the Material and the [[Spiritual Realm]], as all mortal life and corresponding research originates from the material.
