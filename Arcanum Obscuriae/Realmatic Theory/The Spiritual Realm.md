Introduction:
Within Planar Theory the Spiritual Realm represents the immaterial spiritual World, all [[Greater Spirit]]s reside here.
Research into the Spiritual Realm and its nature is extremely limited, compared to Planar Theory, and is largely based on contact with the [[Fey]], as creatures that exist in both the material and the spiritual realm, as well as certain magical practices such as [[Kobold Shamanism]] that allow sentient beings of the [[The Material Realm]] to cross over into the spiritual.
