<h2>Chapter 1: Realmatic Theory</h2>
<h4>The Material and Spiritual Realm</h4>
<p>Since the dawn of the Jiravid and the great cities in Palmunis and Rakh, the exitance of of a world of spirits and ghosts has been known and verified by arcane scholars. In his infamous Tablets, the rakhian mage Phiodales of Mizk shows the Spiritual Realm as an underlying mirror-world beneath our own, the Material Realm, where great entities of thought and will reside. Traversal between realms is usually only possibly on a physical sense with usage of tremendous planar energy, outside of the obscure usage of the later described Dulmic Gates, but there are those beings, broadly classified as Spirits who exist primarily within the spiritual Realm as well as creatures or entities that exist in haptic forms in more than 1 realm of existence such as the Fey dubbed "Cross-Realm-Entities".  </p>
<h4>The Dulmic Gate</h4>
<p>Named after the ancient urien tomb structures, a Dulmic Gates describes a tunnel between the Realms, where spiritual and material sentiences can traverse. While initially thought of as literal Gates, due to the appearence of observable tunnels within said Dulmic gate-like structures, this term has been widely appropriated to refer to any kind of realmatic access point to the Harlinic Space(see below) in modern times.</p>

<h4>Realmatic Exchange and the Harlinic Model<h4>

<p>Named after its discoverer Harlini, a vihri Mage of the 9th century, Harlinic Space describes the semi-permeable space between the Spiritual and Material Realm and how the two forces of Consciousness and Harmony Push against each other within it. This Realmatic Model was mainly developed as a Result of Planar-Force-Theory becoming more publicly accepted as will be discussed further below. Harlini describes the constant ebb and flow in both directions of observable energy as "Realmatic Exchange" and posits that it is the driving activation force of the Dulmic Gates that allow traversal between the Realms.</p>

<h4>The Astral Realm</h4> 
<p>The Astral Realm describes a semi-physical and immaterial space as a third Realm within realmatic Theory. Notably it is largely defined by not existing inbetween the Harlinic Space between the Material and Spiritual Realm and is best envisioned as "sorrounding environment" that exists as a layer above the Material Realm. It was proven to exist by the elven Wizard Carassa al-Kael and is infamously utilized by illegal teleportation spells, although many types of conjuration and scrying magicks access it as well. </p>
