Introduction:
Within Planar Theory the Spiritual Realm represents the immaterial spiritual World.
Research into the Spiritual Realm and its nature is extremely limited, compared to Planar Theory, and is largely based on contact with the [[Fey]], as creatures that exist in both the material and the spiritual realm, as well as certain magical practices such as [[Kobold Shamanism]] that allow sentient beings of the [[The Material Realm]] to cross over into the spiritual.
